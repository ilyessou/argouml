Containment</h2></div></div><p>Critics concerning containment in ArgoUML, that is where one
      artifact forms a component part of another.</p><p>The current version of ArgoUML has six critics in this
      category.</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="s2.ref.critics_circular_composition"></a>13.17.1. Remove Circular Composition</h3></div></div><p>Suggestion that there is a series of composition relationships
        (associations with black diamonds) that form a cycle, which is not
        permitted.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="s2.ref.critics_dup_param_name"></a>13.17.2. Duplicate Parameter Name</h3></div></div><p>Suggestion that a parameter list to an operation or event has two
        or more parameters with the same name, which is not
        permitted.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="s2.ref.critics_multiple_agg"></a>13.17.3. Two Aggregate Ends (Roles) in Binary Association</h3></div></div><p>Only one end (role) of a binary association can be aggregate or
        composite. This a well-formedness rule of the UML 1.3 standard.</p><p>Aggregation and composition are used to indicate whole-part
        relationships, and by definition, the &#8220;part&#8221; end cannot be
        aggregate.</p><p>To fix this, identify the &#8220;part&#8221; end of the
        association, and use the critic wizard (the <tt>Next&gt;</tt>
        button, or manually set its aggregation to <tt>none</tt>
        using the button&nbsp;2 pop-up menu or the property sheet.</p><p>Composition (more correctly called composite aggregation) is used
        where there is a whole-part relationship that is one-to-one or
        one-to-many, and the lifetime of the part is inextricably tied to the
        lifetime of the whole. Instances of the whole will have responsibility
        for creating and destroying instances of the associated part. This also
        means that a class can only be a part in one composite
        aggregation.</p><p>An example of a composite aggregation might be a database of cars
        and their wheels. This is a one-to-four relationship, and the database
        entry for a wheel is associated with its car. When the car ceases to
        exist in the database, so do its wheels.</p><p>Aggregation (more correctly called shared aggregation) is used
        where there is a whole-part relationship, that does not meet the
        criteria for a composite aggregation. An example might be a database of
        university courses and the students that attend them. There is a
        whole-part relationship between courses and students. However there is
        no lifetime relationship between students and course (a student
        continues to exist even after a course is finished) and the
        relationship is many-to-many.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="s2.ref.critics_n_way_agg"></a>13.17.4. Aggregate End (Role) in 3-way (or More) Association</h3></div></div><p>Three-way (or more) associations can not have aggregate ends
        (roles). This a well-formedness rule of the UML 1.3 standard.</p><p>Aggregation and composition are used to indicate whole-part
        relationships, and by definition can only apply to binary associations
        between artifacts.</p><p>To fix this, manually select the association, and set the
        aggregation of each of its ends (roles) to <tt>none</tt>
