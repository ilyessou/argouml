Notes on how to install and compile the UCI Graph Editing Framework
source code.

This file prepared: 7/30/96.

Basic steps:

1. Unzip or untar the source code archive and you will have the
following directory structure:

<somepath>
        |--uci
             |-- util
             |-- ui
             |-- graphedit
                 |-- contrib
                 |-- demo

Where <somepath> is the place in your directory structure where you
unpacked the files.

2. In your development environment set the CLASSPATH environment
variable so that it includes <somepath>.

3. If you are using Cafe, add all the .java files to your project.

4. Compile, or run make. 

5. If you are on Solaris, run the Makefile in the uci directory with
no options. You may have to edit uci/Makefile.config to
set the proper paths for your java executables.

trouble installing or if you are using a different development
environment, please let me know so that I can include any needed steps
