<p>Basically, I want to have a nice, stable graph editing and
MacDraw-style graphics editing framework.  I need that as a starting
point for a tool I am building for my Ph.D.  research, and I think that
others need a framework like that as well.

<p>Some of the goals of the framework are to support these features:
<UL>
<LI> Full editing of unstructured graphics, so that it is possible to
  make nice looking diagrams.
<LI> Ease of use, so that people who are browsing the web can figure out
  what to do with my demos without having to read a lot of
  documentation.
<LI> Connected graph editing, because that is needed in my application.
<LI> Multiple, coordinated views, so that complex connected graphs can be
  visualized in different ways.
<LI> Easy integration with application specific code, so that people can
  put a graphical front end on their applications without rewriting
  everything around my framework.
<LI> Simple enough for college students to learn and use in 10 weeks.
</UL>

<p>I think it would be really interesting to organanize a "virtual
software development team" over the internet so that: (1) I don't have
to do all the coding myself, (2) the final framework is tempered by
actual application, (3) we all get experience in distributed
development, (4) I get in contact with professional developers for
future collaboration, user testing, and even job offers.  As virtual
team leader I promise to integrate changes, run the project web page,
suggest projects, and avoid duplication of effort.  I am especially
interested in instructors at universities who want to use this
software as material for project classes (see the history section of
the GEF home page).  

<p>The framework should promote the creation of good demos for the
www.  That means that they should download quickly, look nice, have
enough features to look perfesional, and let the user get to the point
of the demo without fighting with a difficult interface.

<p>More importantly, the framework should promote the creation of good
applications.  It should have a rich set of basic features.  It should
be easily customized to a given application.  It should look nice and
be easy to use (or at least be like other applications).

<H2><FONT COLOR="#006600">Section 2.  Overall Architecture</FONT></H2>

<p>There are two main levels in the Graph Editing Framework (GEF)
representation: (1) the net level, and (2) the diagram level.  The net
level holds nodes which are logical objects that may have application
specific data and behavior.  The diagram level made up of
<TT>DiagramElement</TT>s for structured and unstructured graphics that
visually depict the net and various annotations.

<p>I expect that people will use the framework by extending it by adding
new classes.  In Java the class is the most important unit of syntax,
version control, code distribution, and dynamic loading.  I have tried
design the framework so that people never have to modify existing
code.  I don't know if that is not the case yet, but hopefully it will
be.

<p>The graph editor (in class <TT>Editor</TT>) is just a shell that dispatches
control to various other objects that do the actual drawing and
processing of input events.  The supporting classes are in several
clusters described below.



<HR>
<A NAME="ClassClusters">
<H2><FONT COLOR="#006600">Section 3.  Class Clusters</FONT></H2>
<UL>

<LI> <TT>Action</TT>s are classes that define a <TT>doIt()</TT> method
that performs some action in the <TT>Editor</TT>.  For example
<TT>ActionReorder</TT> handles the menu items 'Send to back', 'Bring
to front', etc. Ideally, an action should be used for any modification
or command that the user might want to undo, include in a macro, or
get help about.

<LI> <TT>Mode</TT>s are modes of operation for the <TT>Editor</TT>.  They can
potentially be long term modes, for example preview mode vs. ray
tracing mode.  But so far I have only done short term modes for
selection, modification, and creation of new objects.  For example,
when you drag an object around the <TT>Editor</TT> is in
<TT>ModeModify</TT>, but when you release the mouse button the
<TT>Editor</TT> returns to <TT>ModeSelect</TT>.

<LI> <TT>DiagramElement</TT>s are drawable objects that can be shown
and manipulated in the <TT>Editor</TT>.  <TT>Fig</TT>s (short for
Figures) are basic drawing elements such as lines and
rectangles. <TT>FigList</TT> is the class for groups of <TT>Fig</TT>s.
<TT>Perspective</TT>s are compound drawing elements that represent
objects in the underlying net level representation.

<LI> <TT>Layer</TT>s serve both to group <TT>DiagramElement</TT>s into
transparent overlays (as in many high end drawing packages) and to
manage redraw order and find the objects under a given mouse
point. That is to say, they may serve as both display lists, and pick
lists. Some <TT>Layer</TT>s compute their visualization rather than
storing a list of <TT>DiagramElement</TT>s, for example
<TT>LayerGrid</TT>.

<LI> <TT>Selection</TT>s are objects used by the <TT>Editor</TT> when
the user selects a <TT>DiagramElement</TT>.  <TT>Selection</TT>s are
responsible for drawing handles and handling dragging on handles.  In
the worst case a new kind of <TT>DiagramElement</TT> will need a new
kind of <TT>Selection</TT>, but usually <TT>SelectionHandles</TT> and
<TT>SelectionBox</TT> can be reused.  </UL>

<A NAME="CodingStyle">
<H2><FONT COLOR="#006600">Section 4.  Coding Style</FONT></H2>

<p>I am including this section (1) so that anyone who modifies this code
can work toward the same style that I am tring to achieve throughout
the source code, (2) as a form of documentation so that you know what
you are reading.  Unfortuantly, the code does not consistantly follow
all of these rules yet, but it will.
<UL>
<LI>  Each file starts with some header info: file, classes in this
file, original author's email address, and version control info.

<LI> I am using the <TT>import ...*;</TT> command to keep the code
short.  I perfer to let name conflicts arrise so that I can catch
them, rather than always use explicit package.class names and end up
with code that cannot be changed to the package-name-only
style. (Note: This means that if you make a zip file for use in your
<TT>CLASSPATH</TT>, you must use a version of the zip tool that
includes directory entries.)

<LI> All instance variables are private and their names begin with an
underscore.  If the variable should be accessible then add public or
protected accessor methods with the same name as the variable without
the underscore with "<TT>get</TT>" or "<TT>set</TT>" prepended. For
example: <TT>_lineWidth</TT>, <TT>setLineWidth()</TT>, and
<TT>getLineWidth()</TT>.

<LI>  In general, write short code when possible.

<LI>  Use javadoc for each class, instance variable, and method.  In
general do not put comments in the body of a method.  If you are doing
something complex enough to need a comment, consider breaking it out
into its own commented method.

<LI>  Indicate places of future modifications with
"<TT>// Needs-More-Work: reason</TT>"

<LI> Name all classes with an initial uppercase letter, and all
variables and methods with a lowercase one.  I use the
allTogetherWithCaps naming style.  Name static variables with an
underscore and an inital capital letter, e.g.,
<TT>_PossibleLanguages</TT>.  Name constants with all upper case and
underscores, e.g., <TT>GRIP_MARGIN</TT>.  The constants that are used
to identify properties of <TT>DiagramElement</TT>s are named with a
leading "<TT>p</TT>", e.g., <TT>pLINE_WIDTH</TT>.

<LI> To emphasize clusters of classes I am using what I call the
binomial naming style (I am sure others have thought of this also):
The root class of the cluster has a short name (e.g., <TT>Layer</TT>),
other members of the cluster use that name as a prefix (e.g.,
<TT>LayerGrid</TT>).  This makes many of the class name longer than
they might be normally (e.g., <TT>Grid</TT> would be shorter).  But
this provides a lot of context without having to look at a class
inheritance diagram.  It is also very nice when you have to look at an
alphabetical list of classes.  I try to name class clusters so that
they are not lexigraphically close others (e.g., the Net cluster used
to be named Model, but that lexigraphically overlapped the Mode
cluster).

<LI> The file <A HREF="features.html"> <TT>uci/docs/features.html
</TT></A> lists out all features that are supported by GEF.  This is
the closest thing that GEF has to a requirements document.  Each
feature is marked with an HTML anchor that names the feature.  Javadoc
comments on code that implements a given feature should include a
hyperlink back to the proper feature anchor(s).

<LI> There is a list of bugs in <A HREF="bugs.html"><TT>
uci/doc/bugs.html</TT></A>.  Each bug is marked with an HTML archor
that names the bug.  Javadocs for code that contains a bug, fixes a
bug, or works around a bug should have a hyperlink back to the proper
bug anchor(s).

<LI>  When in doubt, follow Sun java style conventions.
