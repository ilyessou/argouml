Currently there are the following issues on sequence diagrams:

- Replaced FigSeqObject with older version because of compilation errors; will
  have to redo Alexander's changes later. This also includes some work on
  OldLayoutConverter because of changes in the layout algorithm.

- Messages drawing is not complete.

- Nested calls are not implemented yet, though the PortModel is prepared.

- Parallel activations have even no user interface defined. PortModel is
  prepared to hold them.
