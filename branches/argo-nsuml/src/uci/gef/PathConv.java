/** Abstract class that defines a common interface to all of
 *  path-to-coord mapping objects.  These objects store some
 *  information about a point that is defined relative to a path
 *  (e.g., along a FigEdge) and provide methods to get the
 *  coordinates (x, y) for that point.  This allows us to place labels
 *  along a FigEdge and have the label stay in the right place, even
 *  if the FigEdge moves. */
