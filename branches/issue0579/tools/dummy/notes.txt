Default configuration should base everything off of argo.root.dir.

Should be able to set argo.tools.dir to point to a shared tools directory.
Should be able to set argo.lib.dir to point to a shared lib directory
    (containing nsuml etc.)

Should be able to set nsuml.jar.name and/or nsuml.jar.path (or any other jar)
    to point straight to a jar file.

Example of properties settings:

argo.root.dir = /source/argouml
argo.lib.dir = ${argo.root.dir}/lib
nsuml.jar.name = nsuml-0.4.19.jar
nsuml.jar.path = ${argo.lib.dir}/${nsuml.jar.name}

argo.build.dir = ${argo.root.dir}/build
argo.jar.name = argouml.jar
argo.jar.path = ${argo.build.dir}/${argo.jar.name}


Jars will be stored in CVS with version numbers, but will be named
in the installation without.  This allows simplification of the
manifest file.

Modules should refer to jars located in ${argo.build.dir} 
rather than ${argo.lib.dir}, since these will not have version numbers
names but generic names.  Example:

    /source/argouml/lib/nsuml-0.4.19.jar

but

    /source/argouml/build/nsuml.jar


Each module should define its own pointers to the jar files, but they
must use the hierarchical property structure described above.

In theory, installing these changes will be completely transparent,
but should add significant ease-of-configuration for developers
working on multiple source trees.
