  Java Code Generator Unification
  ===============================

I have started to unify the java code generation approaches. The aim is to have all
code for generating parts of a java source file in GeneratorJava.java. The only bits
of code remaining both in the code piece classes and in GeneratorJava.java are the
ones that specify when to generate which piece of code. These classes both call on
methods in GeneratorJava.java to do the actual generation. For the time being I have
implemented this for the actual class frame by separating generateClassifierStart(),
appendClassifierEnd() and generateClassifier() in GeneratorJava.java.

  TODO: Still to be done
  ======================

- All code pieces need to refer to GeneratorJava
- AttributeCodePiece needs to check whether the attribute to be generated is in
  reality an association
- It may be that java.g needs to be adjusted further to make sure that braces etc.
  are not doubly generated. We may need to add some comment type like
  "//{START-ARGO-GENERATED" and "//}END-ARGO-GENERATED" to allow code piece based code
  generation to avoid copying stuff which is being generated, too (specifically: tagged
  values)
  Note that I have already adjusted java.g slightly, to incorporate the opening { into
  ClassCodePiece and InterfaceCodePiece.
