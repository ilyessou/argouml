/**
 * Facade object for the Model component in ArgoUML.<p>
 *
 * The purpose of this Facade object is to allow for decoupling other modules
 * from the insides of the model. For this purpose all of the methods in this
 * class give away and accept handles (of type java.lang.Object) to the
 * objects within the model.<p>
 *
 * This is just getters and recognizers. This is because the Model
 * component has an extremely complicated internal data structure
 * with lots of internal dependencies. To manipulate these there is
 * a whole set of factories and helpers within the Model that is to
 * be used but to use them you need knowledge of the internals of
 * the Model, specifically the NS-UML objects.<p>
 *
 * All methods in this facade are static.<p>
 *
 * Signature for all recognizers in this Facade:
 * public boolean isA<TYPE>(Object handle)
 * public boolean is<PROPERTY>(Object handle)
 * <p>
 *
 * Signature for all getters in this Facade:
 * public Object get<TYPE>(Object handle) - 1..1
 * public Iterator get<TYPES>(Object handle) - 0..*
 * public String getName(Object handle) - Name
 * <p>
