   <title>Long Description</title></head><body bgcolor="white" text="black" link="#0000FF" vlink="#840084" alink="#0000FF"><p>A typical constraints tab. Along the top from the left are
            icons for creating a new constraint, deleting a constraint, editing
            an existing constraint, validating a constraint and altering the
            OCL parameters. To the right of these is a tick box for the
            <tt>Syntax&nbsp;Assistant</tt>. Beneath to the left is a
            panel titled <tt>Constraint Name</tt> (partially
            obscured) with beneath it a list of constraints (two in this
            example). Two small arrows the upper pointing left and the lower
            pointing right are to the right of this panel. The upper arrow
            shrinks the panel to nothing, the lower expands it to the whole
            tab. Finally to the right is a panel titled
            <tt>Preview</tt> containing the text of the
            constraint.</p></body></html>
