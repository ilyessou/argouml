<H2>Argo v05 Example Design: KLAX(tm)</H2>

This page describes an example Argo design document that can be
downloaded for use with Argo v05.

<p><a href="klax.zip">Download example document.</a>

<p>To load the document into Argo do one of the following:
<ul>

<li> <TT>java -ss4m jargo.softarch.klax.Main klax.arg</TT>

<li> <TT>java -ss4m jargo.softarch.klax.Main</TT><br>
then use the "Open..." command to load file "klax.arg".

</ul>

<p>Relevant screenshots of Argo are included in the discussion
below.  Each screenshot is less than 20Kb.

<p>The example document shows a partially specified architecture for a
video game system.  The object of the game is to catch colored tiles
that fall from the top of the window and drop them so that the form
matching rows, columns, or diagnols.  Software components implement
the various parts of the game:

<ul>

<li> One component determines the speed of the game.

<li> Three "ADT" components store the state of tiles in three areas of
the screen.

<li> One component stores the current score and number of lives.

<li> Four "Logic" components encode the rules of the game: scoring,
when a life is lost, what is considered a match, and the distrubtion
of tiles.

<li> Five "Artist" components are each responsible for drawing part of
the game state in one of four areas of the display.

<li> Two components map the display commands used by the artists to
the underlying window system.

<li> A few other components are availble to implement similiar games
with different rules and visulazations. For example, the NextLetter,
Spelling, and LetterArtist components are used to make a spelling game.

</ul>

<p>We have implemented this example system in both Java and C++. The
internals of the components are not of concern in this example.  Here
we focus only on how these components are combined to make a complete
product.


<p>The main Argo window has tabs for each of four design perspectives
on the system under design. 

<ul>
<li> Inter-component communication
     [<a href="klax_comm.gif">screenshot</a>]
<li> Component resources
     [<a href="klax_os.gif">screenshot</a>]
<li> A simple design decision process
     [<a href="klax_proc.gif">screenshot</a>]
<li> Some classes that implement components
     [<a href="klax_uml.gif">screenshot</a>]
</ul>

The designer can pick software components and other design elements
from the palette and place them in the editor [<a
href="klax_palette.gif">screetshot</a>]. This design is only partially
specified and there are many problems and incompletenesses in it.
Some of the issues are identified automatically by design critics as
the designer manipulates the design.  When critics identiify a
potential problem they inform the designer.  Ideally they would use a
range of user interface techniques: more distruptive ones to force the
designer to stop building on fatal mistakes, less distruptive ones to
remind of open issues and violations of rules of thumb. Right now Argo
only provides a non-disruptive "to do" list interface [<a
href="klax_todo.gif">screenshot</a>].

<p>Critics are composed of domain-specific rules and feedback to
present to the designer.  Argo currently provides about 20 critics as
examples of various things that critics can do.  Critics can check the
correctness and completeness of the design based on the syntactic and
semantic rules of the domain.  Critics can also apply rules of thumb
to remind designers of standards practices.  Critics can also be
specific to individual software components (or other design materials)
to inform the designer of the implications of using them.  The
feedback critics provide may directly aid the designer in fixing a
problem, or may remind the designer of unexplored alternatives, or
people in the development organization who hold a stake in the design
decision at hand.

<p>When the designer selects an item of design feedback from the ToDoList
window, Argo attempts to give the designer the information needed to
resolve the issue: (1) presents a brief explanation of the problem and
possible solutions, (2) highlight the "offending" design elements, (3)
allow the designer to jump to background information about the domain
and this issue, (4) allow the designer to contact the person who
authored or maintains the critic thus providing an entry into the
organizational context [<a href="klax_email.gif">screenshot</a>].

<p>The Clock component has a critic that is specific to it that
informs the designer that the component is unreliable on certain
platforms and gives contact information for a person in the
development organization who has had experience with this issue in the
past.  [<a href="klax_unreliable.gif">screenshot</a>] [<a
href="klax_email.gif">screenshot</a>]

<p>Some critics identify problems that can be fixed automatically. For
example when a host does not have enough memory, the critic that
identifies the problem is willing to fix it [<a
href="klax_autofix.gif">screenshot</a>]. In this example it fixes the
problem by adding more memory, ideally it might bring up a wizard to
step the designer through several options.

<p>With a large number of critics in the system, the designer can be
innuncated with too much feedback.  To address this problem Argo uses
a variety of criticism control mechanisms.  The simplest is "hushing"
the critic which puts it to sleep for a short time, after which it
wakes up and may raise the same issue.  The most powerful is uses a
model of the decision categories that the designer is considering at
any given point.  This model is based on the infomation supplied in
the decision process model.  Designers may inspect and manipulate
critics through the "Critics" window [<a
href="klax_critics.gif">screenshot</a>].

<P>[Needs-More-Work: Am I describing the example design, or starting
on a (poorly organized) users guide? ]
