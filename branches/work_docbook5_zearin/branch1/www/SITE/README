This directory contains things that are not really supposed to be published 
on the web site. It doesn't hurt because we don't have any secrets in the
project but they are most likely not looking good in any browser.

Instead the purpose is to provide a place where we can maintain project
specific files that some other parts of the Tigris infrastructure can read.
The reason to keep them in the www subdirectory is that that subdirectory
is always checked out and available on the tigris host so no new mechanisms 
are needed to regularly check them out.

Files:
argouml-template	Default commit Template. See rcsinfo.
