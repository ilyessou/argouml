The internationalization is currently changing from ListResourceBundles
to Property files. This chapter is not updated to fit the change.
Please read carefully.
</p><p>
In ArgoUML internationalization (sometimes called i18n) is done using
the ListResourceBundle-classes and parts of it is handled by the 
GEF infrastructure.
</p><p>
There are several sets of Bundle files for different domains within ArgoUML.
Each domain has a name and is handled by a file.
This is set up in <tt>org.argouml.application.Main</tt>.
</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e4575"></a>5.9.1. Organising translators</h3></div></div><a class="indexterm" name="d0e4578"></a><a class="indexterm" name="d0e4583"></a><p>
The problems with internationalization are not so much the technical
problems as to how it works but more so the problems are with
getting, keeping and coordinating the correct compentences to do
the job.
This comes from the fact that by necessity the different
persons working with internationalization have different native languages
and that complicates the communications.
</p><p>
To handle this problem for GNU applications 
there is a community set up around gettext with one language team
per language working with all gettext applications.
There are also tools to help the translator do his job
delivered with gettext that are the same for all the applications.
In each of these language teams discussions are held that ensure a
consistant use of words over all these applications.
</p><p>
It is for me (Linus Tolke, May 2002) unclear if and how such a
community exists for Open Source Java tools and ArgoUML cannot
simply benefit from the gettext communities since we don't use
gettext and cannot use the same tools.
</p><p>
To get things done, we organise our own Language Teams with ArgoUML.
Each language teams are actually just one or several persons that
know that language and is eager to work with translating ArgoUML.
</p><p>
The language team has the following responsibilities:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
All localized strings and resources shall be tranlated into the language.
</p><p>
This is a constant work with keeping up with the changes that
will be made to the ArgoUML code since ArgoUML 
is under fast development.
</p></li><li><p>
The terminology used shall be correct.
</p><p>
This requires work in keeping up with the current litterature in the
domain of ArgoUML.
</p></li><li><p>
Help with the improvements on ArgoUML by pin-pointing where ArgoUML
needs to be modified to allow for localization.
</p><p>
As ArgoUML is originally built without localization we still have a
big backlog of stuff in the GUI that is not localizable just by
modifying the resource bundles. 
Each such thing is a Defect and shall be corrected.
</p></li><li><p>
See that the used libraries also provides their part in that language.
</p><p>
This is mostly GEF since GEF is central both when it comes to 
the fact that it has localized strings of its own but also
because it handles parts of the localization.
</p><p>
This means discussing with the teams developing the underlaying package
as to how best to provide the localization for those parts. 
Either by providing localization for that team to include in the
package or by having ArgoUML overriding that package in that respect.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e4620"></a>5.9.2. Ambitions for localization</h3></div></div><p>
Let me (Linus Tolke, May 2002) try to define the levels of
ambition for us to try to make it possible to discuss where
we are going.
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>No translation</p><p>
This is the lowest level of ambition that is a "do nothing"-level.
This goes for all languages where we have not done anything like
Swahili, Polish, South African English, ...
</p></li><li><p>Tool translation</p><p>
This is the basic level of ambition that each Language Team should
aim for.
It means that in ArgoUML all strings are localized so that ArgoUML
is giving a complete appearance of being a tool for that language.
</p><p>
Setting this level of ambition for a language
(or creating a team for the language) is pointless
if there is no window system available for the language in questions.
I mean, if neither the people working with 
Windows, Linux (KDE or Gnome) or java has collected enough interest
to do a translation of the basic infrastructure there is no point
in doing so for ArgoUML.
(My Windows 2k has 80 supported languages so I would think that this
is a no-issue.)
</p></li><li><p>User environment translation</p><p>
This is the next level of ambition that can be set out by a 
Language Team that works really well and has plenty of translating
resources left.
</p><p>
It means that not only the ArgoUML tool should be translated but also
everything around it that the user sees 
i.e. the User Manual, the Quick Guide, the FAQ, 
the Users' part of the ArgoUML Web site.
</p><p>
Setting this level of ambition for a language is pointless
if the problem domain does not exist in that language.
I mean, if the professionals that use UML or other 
Software Engineering tools, in their every day work don't use 
their native language to discuss UML concepts,
then there is no use in translating these concepts to their language,
they will not use the translation because they are more
comfortable with the English concepts.
Note that the UML Specification does only exist in English.
</p></li><li><p>Development environment translation</p><p>
Here I mean that everything that the developer of ArgoUML sees
shall be translated.
</p><p>
This begins with this Cookbook, then the Developers' part of the
ArgoUML web site and 
also includes the javadoc comments in the code of ArgoUML and
design documentation of included packages such as GEF, NSUML...
</p><p>
For translating the javadoc there exists no good tools.
</p><p>
This is pointless unless we have identified an extremely large
developer base willing to take on big parts of of the ArgoUML
development that is
speaking one specific language and where most of them does not
know English.
</p><p>
If any Language Team would consider this, 
probably after several years of extremely good work on the 
User environment translation ambition level
it is a decision not only concerning that language team but the whole
ArgoUML development community.
</p><p>
Maybe I (Linus Tolke) has gone a little over the top now in trying 
to define things far off the side of the planet.
It is probably just me but I find a weird pleasure in encouraging people
to strive for unreachable goals.
</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="howdoi_internationalization"></a>5.9.3. How do I ...?</h3></div></div><p>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>...verify that all translations are up to date?</p><p>
Run the JUnit test cases.
See <a href="ch02s04.html#run_junit_testcases" title="2.4.2.1. How to run the old style test cases">Section 2.4.2.1</a>.
This will verify that all tags are in synch between different
translations.
</p></li><li><p>...start a new Language Team?</p><p>
The Language Teams are loosely defined by
the web page of language teams on the Tigris site.
As soon as the language code and names (at least one) are in place
the teams is created.
</p><p>
From that point it is the Language Teams responsibility to 
do a good job.
</p></li><li><p>
...find the languages internationalization code for the language you 
will add: en, es, en_GB,...
</p><p>
The one you are currently using is shown in the log when ArgoUML starts.
Search for lines looking like:
<tt>
Language: sh
Country: unknown
</tt>
</p></li><li><p>...start the work?</p><p>
Look at the files in
<tt>org/argouml/i18n</tt>,
under <tt>argouml/src_new</tt>.
</p><p>
Translate all the texts in each of these classes of files.
</p><p>
This is a lot of extremely qualified work including searching well-known
litterature on UML and Software Engineering in order to get the correct
terms for the domain.
Discuss with other UML and Software Engineering professionals with the
same native language to get it right.
</p><p>
Create the files with the translations and store them in
<tt>argouml/src_new/org/argouml/i18n</tt>.
They will have the names:
<tt>UMLResourceBundle_<i><tt>language code</tt></i>.java</tt>,
<tt>UMLCognitiveResourceBundle_<i><tt>language code</tt></i>.java</tt>,
<tt>ActionResourceBundle_<i><tt>language code</tt></i>.java</tt>,
<tt>SettingsResourceBundle_<i><tt>language code</tt></i>.java</tt>,
<tt>MenuResourceBundle_<i><tt>language code</tt></i>.java</tt>,
<tt>DiagramResourceBundle_<i><tt>language code</tt></i>.java</tt>,
<tt>TreeResourceBundle_<i><tt>language code</tt></i>.java</tt>, and
<tt>NotationResourceBundle_<i><tt>language code</tt></i>.java</tt>.
</p><p>
Add the language to the JUnit list of tested languages and run the JUnit tests.
</p><p>
The purpose of this is for you to get the simple JUnit tests to work for
your language also.
</p><p>
This is in the file
<tt>argouml/modules/junit/src/org/argouml/util/CheckResourceBundle.java</tt>.
Search for the supportedLanguages-array.
</p><p>
Now you have completed the first iteration of the Tool translation
ambition.
The work will probably be more maintenance-like from here on.
</p></li><li><p>...join an existing Language Team</p><p>
Discuss with the Language Team on where the team is in its work
and what you can do.
</p></li><li><p>...add or modify code with localized things?</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Write your code using the same way of handling strings as the surrounding code.
</p><p>
This means that strings are denoted by "labels" or "tags" and then
the resolution of the "tag" is in a 
<tt><i><tt>Domain</tt></i>ResourceBundle.java</tt>-file.
</p><p>
The name for the domain is most often specified in a variable like
<pre class="programlisting">
    protected static final String BUNDLE = <i><tt>Domain</tt></i>;
</pre>
or
</p><div class="programlistingco">
    protected static final String RESOURCE_BUNDLE = <i><tt>Domain</tt></i>;
</div><p>
in a base class to what you are doing and there is 
a convenience method in the class
<tt>org.argouml.application.api.Argo</tt>
so normal strings are written
<pre class="programlisting">
import org.argouml.application.api.*;
...
    String localized = Argo.localize(BUNDLE, <i><tt>tag</tt></i>);
</pre>
</p></li><li><p>
Add your "tag" and resolution in English in the non-localized 
<tt><i><tt>Domain</tt></i>ResourceBundle.java</tt>-file.
</p><p>
How do I choose the tag?
Jean-Hugues de Raigniac has made a small investigation as to how this
is done in the java world and found that there is no real consensus on
how to do this.
He suggests a hierarchical choice of tags like this:
<pre class="programlisting">
   {"docpane.label.since", "Since"},
   {"docpane.label.deprecated", "Deprecated"},
   {"docpane.label.see", "See"},

   {"stylepane.label.bounds", "Bounds"},
   {"stylepane.label.fill", "Fill"},
   {"stylepane.label.no-fill", "No Fill"},
</pre>
</p></li><li><p>
Contact all the language-teams so that they can update their files.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Notice that if you somewhere change the meaning of a specific
localized thing it would be a good idea to use a new "tag" for the
new meaning.
This will make it easier for the translation team to
spot the modification.
</p><p>
There eledgedly are tools in the java world to spot this kind of changes.
Until we have the tools and processes in place to handle them
it is better to rely on this simpler mechanism to guarantee correctness.
