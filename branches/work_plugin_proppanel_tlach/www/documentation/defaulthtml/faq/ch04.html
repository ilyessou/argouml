What does GEF mean?
</p></div><div class="answer"><p><a name="Nc11"></a><b> </b>
GEF = Graph Editing Framework - the thing which is hidden in gef.jar and
is responsible for displaying the graphs and which gives you the the
ability to move things around. GEF used to be closely interwoven with
Argo, but is now more or less seperate as far as I know. The sources are
also available via www.tigris.org
</p></div></div><div class="qandaentry"><div class="question"><p><a name="Nc1a"></a><b> </b>
What is PGML?
</p></div><div class="answer"><p><a name="Nc20"></a><b> </b>
PGML is the saving format for diagram information used in Argo and Poseidon. Although this is outdated a little, it shows why we chose PGML in the first place. In the future, PGML will be replaced by an extended XMI format which will include graphical representation. PGML is shortcut for Precision Graphics Markup Language. In April 1998 Adobe Systems proposed a new Standard for Vector Graphics to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which should faciliate the creation and usage of image material in the World Wide Web. It will be replaced by SVG. We will support SVG by generating it from the XMI in the future.

What applications open PGML?
</p></div><div class="answer"><p><a name="Nc2f"></a><b> </b>PGML is a predecessor of SVG. It was droped by the W3C Consortium.</p><p>Currently there are no other tools that we know of working on PGML. We will move to SVG soon. And THAT will be read by many tools.

How can I print my diagrams?
</p></div><div class="answer"><p><a name="Nc41"></a><b> </b>
Select a diagram, then go to File-&gt;Export Diagrams. You can generate
gif, postscript, eps or svg format.
</p></div></div><div class="qandaentry"><div class="question"><p><a name="Nc4a"></a><b> </b>
What does SVG stand for?
</p></div><div class="answer"><p><a name="Nc50"></a><b> </b>
A super cool vector graphics format (like MM Flash) that is totally open
and is gaining enormous ground in the graphics world. Find out more at
the www.W3C.org. </p><p>As well visit Adobe.com for the plugin for NN and IE</p></div></div><div class="qandaentry"><div class="question"><p><a name="Nc5c"></a><b> </b> How do I save my diagrams as .SVG?
</p></div><div class="answer"><p><a name="Nc62"></a><b> </b>First: select .svg as the file type. Second: type the name of the file as you like with the .svg tag at the end. Example myumldiagram.svg</p><p>ARGO does not do it automatically. See the to-do list.</p><p> Et voila! SVG! Give it a try and zoom around a little...They are not pretty though, so if you know anything about rendering beautiful SVG let us know!</p><p>Oh, and by the way, you'll need a browser that can read SVG, the plugin for NN and IE are available at Adobe.com</p><p>There are a few browsers that read SVG natively: Amaya, X-Smiles, and a rudimentary version of Mozilla.</p><p>The first look at ARGO SVG might be a little disappointing...it doesn't bound the text very well and it's preset to 600X 600. 
You can change the size of the SVG by going into the source and changing it manually. </p><p>
If you know how we can set the SVG output to automatically correspond to the diagram itself please let us know!</p><p>See to do list</p><p>Be aware: You will not have scroll bars for your SVG unless it is embedded into an HTML! Good luck and let us know what you find!

							Can I output my entire ZARGO as an .html?
						</p></div><div class="answer"><p><a name="Nc89"></a><b> </b>No not yet. This feature is much desired. Please see the to-do list.</p><p>Use case: File&gt;Save As&gt;project.html&gt;select diagram output i.e. .svg, .gif, .jpg, etc.</p><p>Output would include: java docs.</p><p>Diagrams with rollover functionality i.e. when users rollover diagram elements their is an embedded link to the javadocs.</p></div></div></div><div class="qandadiv"><h3 class="title"><a name="Nc9a">4.2 .XMI</a></h3><div class="qandaentry"><div class="question"><p><a name="Nca1"></a><b> </b>I have a model generated by Rational Rose in xmi format and I want input it into ARGO UML case tool.

Version 0.4.19 is okay, should be interchangable.</p></div></div><div class="qandaentry"><div class="question"><p><a name="Ncbf"></a><b> </b>How do I import an .xmi into ARGO and what formats are known to be supported?</p></div><div class="answer"><p><a name="Ncc5"></a><b> </b>Because of the variety of .xmi formats being generated you will encounter problems using other .xmis generated from other applications. </p><p>ARGOUML's native storage format is another implementation of XMI (Curt Arnold believes that it has been hacked so it can also read the Unisys variant).  He recommends that if you are comfortable with XSLT, you can typically transform one variant of UML + XMI to another, plus MetaIntegrations (http://www.metaintegrations.net) makes a version of their Bridge product available to transform between XMI flavors.</p></div></div><div class="qandaentry"><div class="question"><p><a name="Ncd1"></a><b> </b>Does ARGO UML generate an XMI document?</p></div><div class="answer"><p><a name="Ncd7"></a><b> </b>Yes! Check out the .zARGO file. Open it and Voila! It's tucked inside...</p><p> ARGO saves all .xmi and .pgml and .ARGO files in one zipped .ZARGO file. You can easily extract the .xmi from the .zARGO file using any old generic ZIP application. (PowerArchiver is a cool freeware app for the Win folks). Give it a try and look into the magic of ARGO!</p><p>
Be aware that double clicking will launch a ZIP utility,if one is installed, and NOT ARGO.
