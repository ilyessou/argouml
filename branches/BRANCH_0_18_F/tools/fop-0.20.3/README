This contains a subset of the FOP distribution.

Also, the build directory contains a jar fop-0.20.3-custom.jar which was
compiled from the standard 0.20.3 distribution, but with jimi
in the classpath.  Because of licensing issues,
jimi is not included, and must be placed in the tools/lib
directory before building any documentation which uses png images,
since fop requires the jimi library to handle them.

Detailed instructions:
1. Download the file "jimi1_0.zip" from "http://java.sun.com/products/jimi/".
It contains a file: "JimiProClasses.zip".
2. Copy this file into the argouml\tools\lib directory.
