Multiple phases.
Note 4, 5, and 6 have been rearranged.

Phase 1:  Replace all code "new MThingImpl()"
          with "MFactory.getDefaultFactory().createThing()".

          There are some that cannot be replaced at this time:
	  Expressions do not have Impl() and are not being replaced.

          -- Basically complete --

Phase 2:  Create org.argouml.model.uml.* package structure.

          -- Complete --

Phase 3:  Replace "new M*Expression()" with
          appropriate "org.argouml.model.uml.*.factory" methods.
	  Also include MMultiplicity and M*Expression.

          -- Basically complete --

Phase 4:  Replace "MFactory.getDefaultFactory().createThing()" with
          appropriate "org.argouml.model.uml.*.factory" methods.

          -- Basically complete --

Phase 5:  Add necessary functionality to "org.argouml.model.uml.*.factory"
          methods including a listener.

          -- Basically complete --

Phase 6:  Create a facade for nsuml xmi reader that will ensure
          all classes get looked at after loading and before
	  returning to Argo.

          -- In Process --

Phase 7:  Any other cleanup.
          Design review and modification.
          Listener integration.
          Event Pump integration.
          Testing.

          -- In Process --
