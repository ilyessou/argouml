Multiple phases.

Phase 1:  Replace all code "new MThingImpl()"
          with "MFactory.getDefaultFactory().createThing()".

          There are some that cannot be replaced at this time:
	  Expressions do not have Impl() and are not being replaced.

Phase 2:  Create org.argouml.model.uml.* package structure.

Phase 3:  Replace "new M*Expression()" with
          appropriate "org.argouml.model.uml.*.factory" methods.

Phase 4:  Create a facade for nsuml xmi reader that will ensure
          all classes get looked at after loading and before
	  returning to Argo.

Phase 5:  Replace "MFactory.getDefaultFactory().createThing()" with
          appropriate "org.argouml.model.uml.*.factory" methods.


Phase 6:  Add necessary functionality to "org.argouml.model.uml.*.factory"
          methods including a listener.
