(Not necessarily in priority sequence)

1.   Make sure that there are no references to MThingImpl's anywhere.

     Some places say "instanceof MThingImpl", these should
     be changed to "instanceof MThing".

2.   Replace any string constants that refer to MThings.

3.   Make sure that org.argouml.model.uml.* factories contain stubs
     for everything necessary.   If an element was not created in argo,
     a factory creation method was not manually added to the factory.
     Make sure that the implementation is complete.
     Verify against both the UML 1.3 model and the NSUML api.

4.   Put copyrights in each file.

5.   Complete javadoc comments.

6.   Design how the MElement changes will be pumped out to the rest of Argo.

7.   There are some places where the code returns a default name
     such as "new MInterface".  Should these be run through i18n?
