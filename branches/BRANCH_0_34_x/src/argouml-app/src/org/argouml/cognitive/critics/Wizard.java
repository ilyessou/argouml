/**
 * "Abstract" base class for non-modal wizards.  Each subclass should
 * define its own makeNextPanel methods. Because most
 * wizards will not be run to completion, the panels are constructed
 * only as needed. This implies that Wizards should not initialize
 * many instance variables in their constructors.<p>
 *
 * By convention step 0 is the problem description of the ToDoItem,
 * step 1 is the first panel displayed after the user presses
 * "Next>", and so on.  The problem description panel is not stored in
 * this wizard, only the panels that are specific to the wizard are
 * stored. If the user presses "Back>" enough times to get back to the
 * problem description, backPanel should return null.  A null panel
 * indicates that the problem description should be shown. <p>
 *
 * Several of the comments in this class refer to "context".  Context
 * is the data about this execution of this wizard, for example, values
 * that the user enters in step 1 is part of the context of later steps,
 * and the ToDoItem with its offenders Set is always context.  Most
 * context should be stored in instance variables of Wizard subclasses.
