<h3>ArgoUML the Project</h3>
ArgoUML is not only a free UML modelling tool, it is also an 
Open Source Development project where you are invited to contribute.
<h3>Goals</h3>
The goal of the ArgoUML project is to build an object
oriented design tool that is:
<ul>
  <li>a joy to use
  <li>actually helpful to designers when they
	are making design decisions, by offering
	cognitive support through critics
  <li>completely open source Java (FreeBSD license)
  <li>supporting UML version 1.3
  <li>modular and extensible
  <li>integrated with the web and other Tigris tools.
</ul>
You can also read the <a href="/vision.html">Project Vision</a>
and read the list of <a href="/features.html">features</a> to
learn more about what ArgoUML is capable of already.

<h3>About the Developer Zone</h3>
The developers documentation contains a collection of the tools and 
processes used in the ArgoUML development as well as
descriptions of the design of ArgoUML.
<p>
You are free to look at everything and hopefully you will soon
become an enthusiastic contributor to the project.
