Welcome to ArgoUML!

In case you just downloaded and unzipped your ArgoUML distribution, 

here's how to proceed:

First, you need Java2 installed, get it from http://java.sun.com for your platform. 

Any Java2 JDK or JRE should work, although with Java JRE/JDK 1.3 

there are some minor problems.

Try typing java in a console window to see if Java is successfully installed. 

You should get a list of your options. If not, try reinstalling Java.


Now (after unpacking the distro, which you obviously have done, because this 

file was in it), you should have a bunch of .jar files 

(argouml.jar, nsuml.jar and others...) in your directory.

Please do NOT unpack the .jars! Just leave them as jar files.

Now you can just start the argouml.jar, 

on a Windows platforms by double-clicking it. And you can as well, 

type in a command line console 

java -jar argouml.jar

(this is better because you can see all the 
messages being generated in argo and that makes it easier for you to understand
what's going on and you can copy some of the message (though not all) to the 
clipboard if argo behaves funny...see below)



for example:
You've downloaded argo to the C drive
so your directory looks like this
c:\argo

open your console (for M$ users this is the DOS prompt)
type cd.. to clear your prompt
then type
c>cd..argo
this will give you
c>argo>
then type 
dir 
to see everything in the argo folder, you should have the argouml.jar inside
then type

java -jar argouml.jar

Note that you need all jar files 

in this directory. That's it, ArgoUML should start up now. 

If not, please consider asking on the users mailing list at 

users@argouml.tigris.org
 
or you can subscribe by sending a mail to 

users-subscribe@argouml.tigris.org.

Have fun!
