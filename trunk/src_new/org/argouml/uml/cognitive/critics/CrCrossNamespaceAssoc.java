/**
 * A critic to check that the classifiers associated with the ends of an
 * association are in the same namespace as the association.<p>
 *
 * With hierarchical namespaces, this would appear to allow any
 * association. However the intent would seem to be that, whilst association
 * between packages is reasonable, association between sub-systems or models
 * is not.<p>
 *
 * This is the fourth well-formedness rule for associations in the UML 1.3
 * standard (see section 2.5.3 of the standard).<p>
 *
 * Since ArgoUML currently only supports a single model, and no subsystems,
 * there is no way to trigger the critic at present. Although a deleted
 * classifier will appear in the separate "trash" namespace, this will also
 * delete the association, so the critic will not trigger. However it will be
 * useful for the future when multiple models and sub-systems are
 * supported.<p>
 *
