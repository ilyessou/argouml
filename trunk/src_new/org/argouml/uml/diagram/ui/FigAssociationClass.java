/**
 * An Association Class is represented by 3 seperate Figs
 * FigAssociationClass is the association edge drawn between two classifiers
 * this displays that association properties of the association class.
 * FigClassAssociationClass is the classifier box that displays the class
 * properties of the association class.
 * FigEdgeAssociationClass is the dashed line that joins these two.
 * 
 * Whenever the user attempts to remove or delete one of these parts then all
 * parts must go.
 * Delete would be handled because the model element is deleted and all parts
 * are listening for such an event and will remove themselves.
 * However if the user attempts to just remove from diagram one of these parts
 * then there is no such event. Hence the removeFromDiagram method is
 * overridden to delegate removal from a single removeFromDiagram method on
 * FigAssociationClass.
