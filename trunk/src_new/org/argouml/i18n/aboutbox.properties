\n\
1.  Visit our web site: http://argouml.tigris.org\n\
\n\
2.  Register as a member on Tigris. If not already.\n\
\n\
3.  Request the observer role in the project. If not already.\n\
\n\
4.  Go to Issuezilla (Bugs and Issues).\n\
\n\
5.  Search for the problem among the problems in the database.\n\

\n\
7.  If not found or some of your peculiarities or details is missing, go on.\n\
\n\
8.  Enter a new issue or add information to an already existing issue. Be sure to include what version you are running, what version of jdk, all the steps that lead up to this, what happens, what you expected to happen, what the problem is.\n\
\n\
9.  If the problem is repeatable, rerun with debug logging enabled (java -Dlog4j.configuration=org/argouml/resource/full.lcf -jar argouml.jar) and add the log file argo_full.log to the issue.\n\
\n\
10. Add extra information that might be relevant for the issue as attachments. These could be screen shots, your project file, log files...\n\
\n\
11. You will get updates via mail when someone comments or does something with your issue.\n\
\n\
12. When it is resolved and verified, close the issue after you have accepted the solution.\n\
\n\
By doing this you are taking part in the ArgoUML project contributing information that will lead to making ArgoUML a better product.
