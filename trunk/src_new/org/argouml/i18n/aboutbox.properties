aboutbox.aboutbox-title = About ArgoUML

aboutbox.bugreport = \
	How to report bugs.\n\
	\n\
	As in many software applications, some bugs do exist in ArgoUML.  \
	There are also features that don't function correctly, and \
	there is strange behavior occurring in the application.  \
	Some of these bugs have been found, others have not.\n\
	\n\
	To make sure that the problems you find are \
	known to the ArgoUML project, \
	do the following:\n\
	\n\
	1.  Visit the project web site at http://argouml.tigris.org.\n\
	\n\
	2.  Register as a member on Tigris if you haven't already done so.\n\
	\n\
	3.  Request the Observer role in the project \
	    if you haven't already done so.\n\
	\n\
	4.  Go to Issuezilla (Bugs and Issues).\n\
	\n\
	5.  Search for the bug in the database.\n\
	\n\
	6.  If a search reveals that the bug exists, \
	add the special observations you have made and \
	add yourself as a cc to the Issue, and you are done.  \
	On the other hand, if you can't find the bug, \
	create a new issue.\n\
	\n\
	7.  When creating a new issue or \
	    adding information to an existing Issue be sure to include:\n\
	-+- what version of the application you are running,\n\
	-+- what version of the jdk or jre you're using,\n\
	-+- all the "relevant" steps that lead up to this,\n\
	-+- the test case you ran (if any),\n\
	-+- what you expected to happen as a result of this test case,\n\
	-+- what actually happens, and\n\
	-+- what you believe the problem to be.\n\
	\n\
	8.  If the problem is repeatable, \
	rerun the application with debug logging enabled \
	(java -Dlog4j.configuration=org/argouml/resource/full.lcf \
	-jar argouml.jar) \
	and add the log file argo_full.log to the issue.\n\
	\n\
	9.  Add extra information that might be relevant for the issue \
	as attachments.  \
	These could be screen shots, your project file, log files...\n\
	Don't forget that the ArgoUML is a very open project so \
	if you have trade secrets or other sensible information \
	you must screen these objects before adding them.\n\
	\n\
	10. You will get updates via mail when someone comments or \
	does something with your issue.\n\
	\n\
	11. When the issue you created or have encountered \
	is resolved and verified, \
	close it after you have accepted the solution.\n\
	\n\
	By following the above steps, \
	you are making an important contribution to the ArgoUML project. \
	Your help will make it possible to make ArgoUML a better product. \
	If you want to help even more, by investigating and fixing the \
	problems, you are most welcome.  \
	Start by reading the Chapter 1 in the Cookbook.
