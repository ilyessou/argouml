aboutbox.bugreport = How to report bugs.\n\
\n\
As in many software applications, some bugs do exist in ArgoUML.  In addition, there are features that don't function correctly, and there is strange behaviour occurring in the application. Some of these bugs have been documented, others have not.\n\
\n\
To ascertain whether the problems you find have been documented, do the following:\n\
\n\
1.  Visit our web site at http://argouml.tigris.org.\n\
\n\
2.  Register as a member on Tigris if you haven't already done so.\n\
\n\
3.  Request the observer role in the project if necessary.\n\
\n\
4.  Go to Issuezilla (Bugs and Issues).\n\
\n\
5.  Search for the bug in the database.\n\
\n\
6.  If a search reveals that the bug exists, add yourself as a cc to the Issue, and you are done. On the other hand, if the search reveals that the bug is not present, you can proceed to create a new issue.\n\
\n\
7.  To create a new issue or add information to an already one:\n\
         - be sure to include what version of the application you are running,\n\
         - what version of the jdk the application is using,\n\
         - all the steps that preceded this step,\n\
         - the test case you ran,\n\
         - what you expected to happen as a result of this test case,\n\
         - what actually happens and what you believe the problem to be.\n\
\n\
8.  If the problem is repeatable, rerun the application with debug logging enabled\n\
          (java -Dlog4j.configuration=org/argouml/resource/full.lcf -jar argouml.jar)\n\
          and add the log file argo_full.log to the issue.\n\
\n\
\n\
9. Add extra information that might be relevant for the issue as attachments. These could be screen shots, your project file, log files...\n\
\n\
10. You will get updates via mail when someone comments or does something with your issue.\n\
\n\
11. When it is resolved and verified, close the issue after you have accepted the solution.\n\
\n\
By following the above steps, you are making an important contribution to the ArgoUML project by contributing information that will make ArgoUML a better product.
