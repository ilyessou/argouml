/**
 * <p>A critic to detect when a class can never have more than one instance (of
 * itself of any subclasses), and thus whether it is suitable for declaration
 * as a Singleton (with stereotype &laquo;Singleton&raquo;.<p>
 *
 * <p>This stereotype is used to indicate a class which only ever has a single
 * instance. The critic will trigger whenever a class has stereotype
 * &laquo;Singleton&raquo; (or &laquo;singleton&raquo;), but does not meet the
 * requirements of a Singleton class. These are:</p>
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>An static variable to hold the sole instance of the class;</li>
 *
 *   <li>only private constructors to create the sole instance; and</li>
 *
 *   <li>At least one constructor to override the default constructor.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>The original version would always trigger for any class with stereotype
 * &laquo;Singleton&raquo;. This version includes an implementation for the
 * three tests above!</p>
 *
 * <p>Internally we use some of the static utility methods of the {@link
 * org.argouml.cognitive.critics.CriticUtils CriticUtils} class.</p>
