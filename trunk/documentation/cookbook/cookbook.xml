     <chapter id="Preliminaries">
     <title>Preliminaries</title>
     <sect1 id="starting">
     <title>Getting started</title>
     <para>In order to develop with ArgoUML it is absolutely mandatory to get get the CVS version of ArgoUML. See the ArgoUML website for instructions for that.</para>
     <para>It is also recommended that you check out GEF from <ulink url="http://gef.tigris.org">gef.tigris.org</ulink> because many things in Argo relate to GEF and it is quite handy to have the source code available. Especially since during development cycles new gef libraries to not as frequently get checked into the argouml modules, so it is useful to build the current version for yourself in order to avoid build errors.</para>
     <para>If you want to - but that is really more of a gimmick - get yourself the source of the NSUML library to. But that is not strictly required.
 </para>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 id="Build">
     <title>Build Process</title>
     <para>
     The ArgoUML build process is driven by ant, and it is highly recommend that you stick to that. There are people known to build from JBuilder or Netbeans, but always make sure that your work compile with the plain vanilla build process.
     </para>
      <para>
Ant is a tool written in java developed for Apache that reads an xml-file
with rules telling what to compile to what result and what files to include
in what jar-file.
</para>
      <para>
The rule file is named <filename>build.xml</filename>.
There is one of those in every separately built directory
(<filename class="directory">src_new</filename>,
<filename class="directory">documentation</filename>, and
<filename class="directory">modules/<replaceable>whatever</replaceable></filename>).
</para>

      <sect2>
	<title>How ant is run from the ArgoUML development environment</title>
	<para>
For your convenience the ant tool of the correct version is present in the
cvs repository of ArgoUML in the file 
<filename class="libraryfile">argouml/lib/ant.jar</filename>.
</para>
	<para>
Normally ant is started with the command
<command>ant <replaceable>parameter</replaceable></command>
but the ArgoUML cvs repository does not contain that convenience program
so you would instead have to write:
<command>java -Dant.home=<replaceable>/your/checked/out/copy/of/argouml</replaceable> -classpath <replaceable>a:complex:classpath</replaceable> -jar ant.jar <replaceable>parameter</replaceable></command>.
</para>
	<para>
To help you there are instead two scripts (one for Unix and one for
Windows) that are called <filename>build.sh</filename> and
<filename>build.bat</filename> respectively present in most
of the directories that contain a <filename>build.xml</filename> file.
These contain some definitions of classpath to simplify the setup.
All you have to do is to set the variables JAVA_HOME and ANT_HOME.
</para>
	<para>
By setting JAVA_HOME to different values you can at different times
build with different versions of jdk and java.
</para>
	<para>
By setting ANT_HOME to different values you can at different times
build with different versions of ant.
This does however not work in the Windows case because of
how <filename>build.bat</filename> is written.
</para>
	<sect3>
	  <title>Compiling for Unix</title>
	  <para>
Here is what you need to do in order to compile and run 
your checked out copy of ArgoUML under Unix.
</para>
	  <orderedlist>
	    <listitem>

	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para><command>export JAVA_HOME</command></para>
	      <para>
This is for sh-style shells like sh, ksh, zsh and bash. If you use
csh-style shells like csh and tcsh you will instead have to write
<command>setenv JAVA_HOME <replaceable>/where/you/have/installed/jdk</replaceable></command>.

	<title>How documentation is presented</title>
	<para>
This describes how the documentation arrives on the web site.
</para>
	<sect3>
	  <title>How the ArgoUML web site works</title>
	  <para>
Tigris provides the ArgoUML site to be edited through cvs. Everything
that is checked in under <filename>argouml/www</filename>
becomes immediatly available at the url 
<ulink url="http://argouml.tigris.org/">http://argouml.tigris.org/</ulink>
with some added decorations left and up.
</para>
	  <para>
Example: The file <filename>argouml/www/project.html</filename> is
available at 
<ulink url="http://argouml.tigris.org/project.html">http://argouml.tigris.org/project.html</ulink>.
</para>
	  <para>
This is the way the site is maintained and updated.
</para>
	</sect3>
	<sect3>
	  <title>The ArgoUML documentation</title>
	  <para>
For the ArgoUML project the same documenation shall be available in both
html, pdf and javahelp. To this end the documentation is written in
docbook xml and generated into two versions of html 
(one page per chapter and one page for the whole book),
pdf and javahelp.
</para>
	  <para>
We have tools that does the conversion from docbook xml to html and pdf.
The conversion is done whenever you need to look at the result or when 
you want to present the final result on the web site.
</para>
	  <para>
There is currently four different books generated in this way, 
each its own directory. They are cookbook (this document), faq, 
manual and quick-guide. They are all generated and stored in the
exact same way except for the name of the directory that is one
of <filename class="directory">cookbook</filename>,
<filename class="directory">faq</filename>, 
<filename class="directory">manual</filename> or 
<filename class="directory">quick-guide</filename>.
Below I will reference this directory using 
<filename class="directory"><replaceable>book</replaceable></filename>.
</para>
	  <para>
When a new version of the documentation is to be made available on the
web site the responsible document release person does the following:
</para>
	  <orderedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
He checks out an updated copy of everything needed
and a copy of the <filename class="directory">argouml/www</filename>.
</para>
	      <para>
To be on the safe side, this could be the whole of ArgoUML.
</para>
	      <para>
If wanted, the cvs repository could be tagged and then the tag
can be checked out. This makes it possible to know exactly 
how a certain version of the documentation was generated.
</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
The documentation is generated using <command>build docs</command>.
</para>
	      <para>
This generates all four books and the result appears in 
<filename class="directory">argouml/build/documentation/defaulthtml/<replaceable>book</replaceable></filename>,
<filename class="directory">argouml/build/documentation/printablehtml/<replaceable>book</replaceable></filename>, and
<filename class="directory">argouml/build/documentation/pdf/<replaceable>book</replaceable></filename>.
</para>
	      <para>
This has been done several times before while preparing the release so
no problems are expected. If there are problems then the preparations
was not good enough and the process is best stopped right here.
</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
All the old files are removed from the checked out copy of 
<filename class="directory">argouml/www/documentation/defaulthtml/<replaceable>book</replaceable></filename>, 
<filename class="directory">argouml/www/documentation/printablehtml/<replaceable>book</replaceable></filename>, and
<filename class="directory">argouml/www/documentation/pdf/<replaceable>book</replaceable></filename>.
</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
New files are copied into the checked out copy of www
on top of the previous files there replacing them.
</para>
	      <para>
All the files are copied from
<filename class="directory">argouml/build/documentation/defaulthtml/<replaceable>book</replaceable></filename> to
<filename class="directory">argouml/www/documentation/defaulthtml/<replaceable>book</replaceable></filename>. 
The same for <filename class="directory">printablehtml</filename> and 
<filename class="directory">pdf</filename>.
</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
No longer used files in 
<filename class="directory">argouml/www/documentation</filename>
are removed from cvs and new files are added.
</para>
	      <para><command>cvs -n update</command></para>
	      <para>Watch for "Missing" and "Unknown" files.</para>
	      <para>
The missing files are scheduled to be removed by:
<command>cvs remove <replaceable>each of the missing files</replaceable></command>
</para>
	      <para>
The "Unknown" files are scheduled to be added by:
<command>cvs add <replaceable>each of the added files</replaceable></command>
</para>
	      <para>
This removing of missing files and adding of unknown files may seem
backward but it is from the perspective of cvs.
The missing files are the ones that were present in the previous
version of the documentation and that does not have a replacement,
either because that chapter does not exist anymore or that the tool
generate filenames differently.
The Unknown files are files with filenames that for the same reason
appear from one version of the documentation to the next.
</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
Commit the changes thus publishing it on the web site.
</para>
	      <para>
<command>cvs commit -m'New version of the documentation published'</command>
</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </orderedlist>
	  <sect4>
	    <title>Tools that does the generation</title>
	    <para>
The tools and templates to do the conversion from docbook xml to html,
pdf, and javahelp are developed by other open source projects and
entered in the ArgoUML cvs as a convenience to the developer and
quality responsible of the ArgoUML project.
</para>
	    <para>
The quality responsible is mentioned because 
this makes it possible to afterwards have access to exactly the tool 
that was used to generate a certain version of the documentation.
</para>
	    <para>
When a new release of that tool is provided
and we have decided that we want to move to that version of the tool,
possibly at the same time as doing the necessary tweaks
for that new version in the documentation itself,
the tool is updated in cvs.
This means that ArgoUML cvs only contains released versions of that tool.
If we find an unacceptable bug in any of these tools
we either refrain from moving to that version or 
revert to the previous version of the tool.

From this point on it is important that you do not reuse your branch for 
any work. Only check it out for the purpose of examining how things were
in the branch. Make sure that all other developers that have been looking
at your branch also knows that it is discontinued.

You need the name of the branch, i.e. the 
<replaceable>work_xxxyyy_hisname</replaceable>.
	      </para>
	      <para>
There are two alternatives:
		<itemizedlist>
		  <listitem>
		    <para>
Check out argouml or part of it on that branch:
<command>cvs co -r <replaceable>work_xxxyyy_hisname</replaceable> argouml</command>
		    </para>
		  </listitem>
		  <listitem>
		    <para>
Update your copy of argouml to be on that branch:
<command>cvs update -r <replaceable>work_xxxyyy_hisname</replaceable></command>
		    </para>
		    <para>
Make sure that your copy does not have any uncommited code or else your
your uncommited code will be present in your checked out copy on the branch.
This could, on the other hand, be useful if you want to test if your uncommited
code works also with the additions on that branch.

  <para>Make screen grabs as you go! And here's how...</para> 
  <para>MS Windows</para> 
  <para>You can use the PrintScreen key to copy the screen to the clipboard (as a bitmap), and then you can paste it into another application (such as MS Word, PowerPoint, etc. (maybe Paint, too)) using the Paste function (ctrl-v). MS Word may (depending on your version) allow you to save the document as an HTML page, which creates an html source file and gif files for all the embedded images (i.e. your pasted screen shot).</para> 
  <para>To capture a single window instead of the entire screen, use Alt-PrintScreen.</para> 
  <para>Image resolution is determined by screen size, for best results: 256 colors by 800X600 is good for a full screen capture.</para> 
  <para>Thanks to Derek for that little tip!</para> 
  <para>Do a search on any of your favorite freeware sites for more elaborate applications. Snagit from techsmith has been recommended</para> 
  <para>Linux</para>
