    <title>Organization of ArgoUML documentation</title>
    <section>
    <title>Overview</title>
    <para>
There are seven significantly different bits of documentation in the
ArgoUML project.
By documentation I mean some information of the product that is
developed alongside the product and that has a persistent value.

These different bits have all different purpose and audience and
the purpose of this chapter is to try to define that.
