Purpose &ndash; To provide support for the use, definition and 
management of UML profiles with ArgoUML.
  </para>
  <para>
The Profile subsystem is located in the package 
<classname>org.argouml.profile</classname> and its subpackages.
In package <classname>org.argouml.profile</classname> there are classes that 
define almost all the subsystem API, concerning the definition and management 
of UML profiles. 
The package <classname>org.argouml.profile.init</classname> contains the 
remaining subsystem API, being its only purpose to provide the subsystem 
initialization API (this is therefore of use only to a minority of external 
subsystems).
  </para>
  <para>
TODO: place here a simple picture of the subsystem.
  </para>
  <para>
The profile subsystem is similar in some ways to the model subsystem &ndash; 
there is a <classname>ProfileFacade</classname> that is the main entry point 
to the methods and classes that provide management functions to the subsystem 
(notably the <classname>ProfileManager</classname>).
It also maintains a one to one relationship with the remaining subsystems of 
ArgoUML, although it is not Singleton based in order to facilitate testing 
and easy cleanup or reset of its internal state. 
The classes that provide support for defining profiles are explained in <xref
        linkend="profile-subsys-design"></xref>
