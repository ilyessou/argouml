	    <para>
Used to denote that a certain issue cannot be resolved until
some special upcoming and planned-for event has happened.
The event in question is noted in the target milestone.
</para>
	    <para>
Events can be things like, dropping support for a jdk version,
changing the version of UML that we support, or
replacing some central mechanism within ArgoUML.
Once they have a target milestone registered,
they are considered events.
</para>
	  </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>REMIND</para>
              <para>
Not used.
</para>
	      <sidebar>
	        <para>
Rationale: Each issue have basically four states:
<orderedlist>
		  <listitem>
		    <para>NEW/STARTED/REOPENED - To be resolved</para>
		  </listitem>
		  <listitem>
		    <para>RESOLVED - To be verified</para>
		  </listitem>
		  <listitem>
		    <para>VERIFIED - To be closed</para>
		  </listitem>
		  <listitem>
		    <para>CLOSED - Finished.</para>
		  </listitem>
		</orderedlist>
The statistics is based on this and persons looking for 
issues to resolve look among the "To be resolved"-group
(the web pages to help in this are set up in this way).
This is also in synch with our release process.
</para>
	      <para>
Looking at it from a single persons perspective an issue is either a
"I could work with this issue but I currently don't",
"I work with this one", or
"I am now done with my work on this issue".
For a resolver this is corresponds to NEW/REOPEN for the first group,
STARTED for the second and
RESOLVED for the third.
For a verifier this corresponds to 
RESOLVED for the first group and
VERIFIED for the third group.
</para>
	      <para>
The RESOLVED/REMIND does not fit this.
They risk to be verified because the rest of our process urges
people to resolve issues that are RESOLVED
in which case they are probably lost.

They risk to be hanging in the RESOLVED state because nobody understands 
where they should go from there.

It is not clear who is responsible to move them forward.
The person that "resolved" them or someone else.
Someone risk to think that there is nothing left to do since it is resolved 
and if so his options of doing work are reduced which could lead to that 
he actually does less with ArgoUML than he else would.
</para>
	      <para>
To amend this we have made two things:
<orderedlist>
		  <listitem>
		    <para>Decided that we don't use the
RESOLVED/REMIND
states.
</para>
		  </listitem>
		  <listitem>
		    <para>At every release,
as part of the release process,
clean up issues that for some mysterious reason ended up
in these states
(See <xref linkend="release_process"/>,
<xref linkend="issuezilla_release_maintenance"/>,
<xref linkend="reopen_remind_and_later"/>)
</para>
		  </listitem>
		</orderedlist>
</para>
	      <para>
If you plan to solve an issue now,
assign it to you,
start it, and 
set the target milestone to the release you plan to have it solved.
This will signal to everyone that you have the responsibility,
will pursue it, and your time plan.
</para>
	      <para>
If you don't plan to solve this now,
leave it in the "up for grabs"-pile (as not resolved).
Somebody else might want to work with it.
</para>
	      <para>
If you know that an issue cannot be resolved now because it requires
that another issue is solved before,
register the other issue as "depends on" and leave the issue in the 
"up for grabs"-pile (as not resolved).
</para>
	      <para>
If you know that an issue cannot be resolved now because it requires
some big event to take place,
put the milestone for that event in the target milestone and
resolve the issue as RESOLVED/LATER.

              <para>
This means that it works in a released version of ArgoUML.
State the version in the comment.
</para>
              <para>
If the version stated by the reporter in the issue is not
the same as the version in the comment then this probably 
means that problem was fixed in some release without anyone
noticing that this problem was fixed.

      <para>
The roles described below are per issue, i.e. for every issue, there
is at least a reporter, a resolver and a verifier.

Hence, each person involved in issues for the ArgoUML project can -
at the same time - have different roles, and consequently, has 
issues to report, 
issues to close, 
issues to resolve, and 
issues to verify.
</para>

        <title>The Reporter</title>
        <para>
The Reporter is the person who enters the issue in Issuezilla.

Answer clarification requests

              <para>
Occasionally, the developers of ArgoUML need to request
the Reporter more information, to be able to solve the issue correctly.
Another way of putting it is to say that 
if the issue was reported without some vital information
the Reporter has some more work to do.
</para>

Close the issue
</para>
              <para>
This applies to an issue that is in verified state only.
At the end of processing the issue, 
the reporter has the final word: 
he can check the result, 
and if he agrees with the solution, 
close the issue himself.
Closing an issue requires at least "observer" role
in the ArgoUML project.

This applies to an issue that is in verified state only.
The reporter has the final word:
he can check the result,

he can reopen the issue himself.
Reopening an issue requires at least "observer" role
in the ArgoUML project.

      <sect2 id="roleresolver">
        <title>The Resolver</title>
        <para>
The Resolver is the software developer who attempts to resolve the issue.
Doing so requires at least "observer" role.
The "developer" role is only needed to commit things into CVS
(e.g. submit changed Java code, scripts or documentation).
</para>
        <para>
Remark: Someone who does not have the developer role, 
but solves the issue and convinces someone else to commit the solution, 
is still the Resolver even though he cannot commit things into CVS.
</para>
        <para>
The goal of the Resolver is to progress the issue to the status of
"Resolved".
The resolver may be the same person as the reporter.

              <para>
Decide usefulness 
(if this issue is really a bug or enhancement and if it is worth solving)
</para>
        <para>
The Resolver has to decide if solving the issue is 
really a useful improvement for ArgoUML.
The Reporter of the issue may very well be mistaken
in entering a bug-issue for what is in fact a feature,
or entering an enhancement-issue which is not really an enhancement.
Another thing that could be is a bug that appears in 
very exceptional circumstances and that
may have large impact on ArgoUML architecture.
If the Resolver decides after the investigation that this bug
is really not that important or that he is not the right person
to solve it he enters his findings as a comment and
assigns the issue back to anyone (issues@argouml) and
moves along to work on another issue instead.
</para>

              <para>
If applicable, program and test a solution
</para>
              <para>
As this might take considerable time it might be a good idea
of the Resolver to assign the issue to himself to reserve the issue.
He can also signal progress by setting the issue to the state Started.

he puts it in "Resolved" status, and indicates the

      <sect2 id="roleverifier">
        <title>The Verifier</title>
        <para>
The Verifier may be neither the Reporter, nor the Resolver of the issue.
The task of the Verifier is to check the quality of the solution by
confirming that the solution is complete, to the point, bug-free, etc.
This is an important part of the quality assurance work we do
in the ArgoUML project and the object is to make sure that a resolved
issue is in fact resolved.

If you, at this point, feel that your personal plans have changed
so that you won't have time to pursue the work,
change the Issue back to "NEW" with your experiences sofar
stated in the comment.
This means that you are giving up and giving the Issue back to
anyone.
You should also assign it back to issues@argouml or if you know
someone else in the ArgoUML team that will continue the work,
assign it to him.
Remember not to commit your changes in the main branch but please
commit your changes (if any) into a work branch and state the name
of the branch in the issue.

        <primary>subproducts</primary>
      </indexterm>
      <para>
ArgoUML uses products internally and is very 
dependant on that these products are functioning well.
This are products like GEF, NS-UML, ocl, log4j, xerces, jre, ...
</para>
      <para>
Occasionally a problem found in ArgoUML is found to be a problem in one
of these subproducts and cannot or is extremely complicated to fix
within ArgoUML.
</para>
      <para>
If this happens this is the way to handle this problem.
</para>
      <para>
This can be performed by any member of the project (any role).
There might be special skills involved depending on the nature of the problem.
In this description "issue" means a issue in issuezilla,
"bug report" means a bug report in some other project,
and "problem" denotes the conceptual problem.
</para>
      <para>
Do the following:
</para>
      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
During your examination of an issue you find that the problem
is in one of the ArgoUML subproducts (GEF, NS-UML, ocl, jre, ...).
</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
Make sure that the issue is assigned to you.
</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
Write a comment in the issue stating which one of the subproducts
that has the problem (and what the problem is within that subproduct).
</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
Post a bug report in that subproducts bug reporting tool
(or find that a bug report already registered).
</para>
          <para>
I am assuming that there is such a tool for the subproduct in question.
If there isn't,
then make the bug report to the person responsible for this product
so that we are sure that the problem is communicated.
</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
Accept the issue (set it to STARTED) and
enter the reference from the subproducts bug reporting tool and
if possible the URL to the bug reporting tool or to the bug report in question.
</para>
          <para>
I am assuming that there is a bug reporting tool for the subproducts.
If there isn't for the product in question,
then include all communications (both ways) in the issue.
</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      <para>
You are now responsible to follow up on 
the upcoming releases of the subproduct.
If you don't think that you are the best person for this
(you should be since it was you that found that this problem
is in the subproduct),
assign the issue to "the right person".
To follow up you should do the following.
</para>
      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
Look at each new release of that subproduct to see if the bug report
is in fact stated as fixed in that release.
</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
If the bug report is fixed, then you weight together 
the importance of the problem, 
other bug reports that are also problems in ArgoUML 
that are solved in that release,
the amount of work needed to fit the new version of the subproduct
instead of the old one,
the planned releases of the subproduct with promises to
solve other bug reports,
and
the current release plan of ArgoUML.
From this you decide wether it is time to do the update of 
the subproduct within ArgoUML or to wait.
</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
If you decide that it is time to update,
you assign all issues against that subproduct to you (if not already), 
then you do the work.
The work is to add the new version of the subproduct to ArgoUML,
do all the needed work within ArgoUML to fit the new version,
test and commit everything,
put the issues indeed fixed in RESOLVED/FIXED,
and close the bugs registered in the subproducts bug reporting tool.
