Purpose - to provide the infrastructure that the other subsystems can
use to translate strings;
to provide the infrastructure that makes it possible to plug in
new languages;
to administer the default (English U.S.) language;
to administer all supported languages.
</para>
      <para>
The Internationalization is located in <classname>org.argouml.i18n</classname>
in the class path.
In the checked out copy of ArgoUML it is located partly in
<filename>argouml/src_new/org/argouml/i18n</filename> 
- functionality, and non-localized default language (US English), 
and partly in
<filename>argouml/src/i18n/<replaceable>language</replaceable>/src/org/argouml</filename>
- all files for a specific language.
</para>
      <para>
The Internationalization is a Layer 0 subsystem. 
See <xref linkend="layer0"></xref>.
</para>

      <para>
The internationalization is currently changing from ListResourceBundles
to Property files. This chapter is not entirely updated to fit the change.
Please read carefully.
</para>
      <para>
In ArgoUML internationalization (sometimes called i18n) is done using
the property files.
In some cases there are instead ListResourceBundle classes but they
will be changed to property files as soon as the problems with the transition
is overcome.

	</indexterm>
	<para>
The problems with internationalization are not so much the technical
problems as to how it works but more so the problems are with
getting, keeping and coordinating the correct competences to do
the job.
This comes from the fact that by necessity the different
persons working with internationalization have different native languages
and that complicates the communications.
</para>
	<para>
To handle this problem for GNU applications 
there is a community set up around gettext with one language team
per language working with all gettext applications.
There are also tools to help the translator do his job
delivered with gettext that are the same for all the applications.
In each of these language teams discussions are held that ensure a
consistent use of words over all these applications.
</para>
	<para>
It is for me (Linus Tolke, May 2002) unclear if and how such a
community exists for Open Source Java tools and ArgoUML cannot
simply benefit from the gettext communities since we don't use
gettext and cannot use the same tools.
</para>
	<para>
To get things done, we organize our own Language Teams with ArgoUML.
Each language teams are actually just one or several persons that
know that language and are eager to work with translating ArgoUML.
</para>
	<para>
The language team has the following responsibilities:
<orderedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
All localized strings and resources shall be translated into the language.
</para>
	      <para>
This is a constant work with keeping up with the changes that
will be made to the ArgoUML code since ArgoUML 
is under fast development.
</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
The terminology used shall be correct.
</para>
	      <para>
This requires work in keeping up with the current literature in the
domain of ArgoUML.
</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
Help with the improvements on ArgoUML by pin-pointing where ArgoUML
needs to be modified to allow for localization.
</para>
	      <para>
As ArgoUML is originally built without localization we still have a
big backlog of stuff in the GUI that is not localizable just by
modifying the resource bundles. 
Each such thing is a Defect and shall be corrected.
</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
See that the used libraries also provide their part in that language.
</para>
	      <para>
This is mostly GEF since GEF is central both when it comes to 
the fact that it has localized strings of its own but also
because it handles parts of the localization.
</para>
	      <para>
This means discussing with the teams developing the underlying package
as to how best to provide the localization for those parts. 
Either by providing localization for that team to include in the
package or by having ArgoUML overriding that package in that respect.
</para>

	<title>Ambitions for localization</title>
	<para>
Let me (Linus Tolke, May 2002) try to define the levels of
ambition for us to try to make it possible to discuss where
we are going.
</para>
	<orderedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>No translation</para>
	    <para>
This is the lowest level of ambition that is a "do nothing"-level.
This goes for all languages where we have not done anything like
Swahili, Polish, South African English, ...
</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>Tool translation</para>
	    <para>
This is the basic level of ambition that each Language Team should
aim for.
It means that in ArgoUML all strings are localized so that ArgoUML
is giving a complete appearance of being a tool for that language.
</para>
	    <para>
Setting this level of ambition for a language
(or creating a team for the language) is pointless
if there is no window system available for the language in questions.
I mean, if neither the people working with 
Windows, Linux (KDE or Gnome) or java has collected enough interest
to do a translation of the basic infrastructure there is no point
in doing so for ArgoUML.
(My Windows 2k has 80 supported languages so I would think that this
is a no-issue.)
</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>User environment translation</para>
	    <para>
This is the next level of ambition that can be set out by a 
Language Team that works really well and has plenty of translation
resources left.
</para>
	    <para>
It means that not only the ArgoUML tool should be translated but also
everything around it that the user sees 
i.e. the User Manual, the Quick Guide, the FAQ, 
the Users' part of the ArgoUML Web site.
</para>
	    <para>
Setting this level of ambition for a language is pointless
if the problem domain does not exist in that language.
I mean, if the professionals that use UML or other 
Software Engineering tools, in their every day work don't use 
their native language to discuss UML concepts,
then there is no use in translating these concepts to their language,
they will not use the translation because they are more
comfortable with the English concepts.
Note that the UML Specification does only exist in English
and a natural part of this level of ambition would probably
be to translate that.
</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>Development environment translation</para>
	    <para>
Here I mean that everything that the developer of ArgoUML sees
is translated.
</para>
	    <para>
We don't do this in the ArgoUML project.
</para>
	    <para>
This begins with this Cookbook, then the Developers' part of the
ArgoUML web site and 
also includes the javadoc comments in the code of ArgoUML and
design documentation of included packages such as GEF, NSUML...

The java files in

containing list resources instead of property files,
are eventually to be converted to property files.
Until then the java file for your language 
<filename>UMLCognitiveResourceBundle_<replaceable>language code</replaceable>.java</filename>
shall be stored in 
<filename class="directory">argouml/src_new/org/argouml/i18n</filename>.

This completes the first iteration of the Tool translation.
The work will probably be more maintenance-like from here on.

		<listitem>
		  <para>
Everywhere you would output a string in the GUI you should instead 
localize a key.
</para>
		  <para>
This means that instead of writing a string you write a call to a
localizer method with a "key" ("label" or "tag") as argument and
the localizer method finds
the resolution of the "key" is in one of the property files.
Which property file it uses depends on the current localization settings
of your running ArgoUML instance.
While developing you should use en_US or some language
that does not exist at all.
</para>
		  <para>
The key is a string.
The key has a special syntax like this:
<programlisting>
    word1.word2.word3
</programlisting>
where word1 is the same as the first part of the filename that 
the key resides in.
Example:
The key "action.about-argouml" resides in the files
<filename>action.properties</filename> and 
<filename>action_<replaceable>language code</replaceable>.properties</filename>.
</para>
                  <para>
You will have to call the class
<classname>org.argouml.i18n.Translator</classname>
to convert them to wherever they are used.
</para>
                  <para>
This is how a real example would look like:
<programlisting>
import org.argouml.i18n.Translator;
...
    String localized = Translator.localize(<replaceable>key</replaceable>);
</programlisting>
</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
		  <para>
Add your "key" and resolution in English (U.S.) in the non-localized 
properties file.
</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
		  <para>
Contact the language-teams so that they can update their files.
</para>
                  <para>
Currently (November 2003) there is a great confusion as to where
we stand on the different translations.
For this reason we can't say if any language team is up to date
with the changes and served by such a contact.
</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
		  <para>
If you have strings that are sentences where you have dynamic values
like a file name, a class name, or some property to enter at a certain place,
remember that all languages would not write it exactly like that.
Use <classname>MessageFormat</classname> to build every such sentence!
There is a convenience function in <classname>Translator</classname>
called <methodname>messageFormat</methodname>.
</para>
		</listitem>
	      </orderedlist>
	      <para>
Notice that if you somewhere change the meaning of a specific
localized thing it would be a good idea to use a new "key" for the
new meaning.
This will make it easier for the translation team to
spot the modification.
</para>
	      <para>
There allegedly are tools in the java world to spot this kind of changes.
Until we have the tools and processes in place to handle them
it is better to rely on this simpler mechanism to guarantee correctness.
