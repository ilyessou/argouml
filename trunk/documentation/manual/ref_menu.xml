  <title>The Menu bar</title>

  <sect1>
    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>An important principle behind &argouml; is that actions should be
      able to be invoked in whatever way the user finds convenient. As a result
      many (but not all) actions that can be carried out on the menu can be
      carried out in other ways as well under &argouml;.</para>

    <para>A number of the common menu entries are also available through
      keyboard shortcuts.</para>

    <warning><para>It should also be possible to navigate the menu from the
      keyboard, Motif style. Each level of each menu is identified by a letter
      (shown underlined in the menu or entry name). This sequence of letters
      while holding down the ALT key should select the entry. In the current
      version of &argouml; this functionality is only available when running
      under Microsoft Windows.</para></warning>

  <sect1>
    <title>The File Menu</title>

    <para>These are actions concerned with input and output and the overall
      management of projects and the &argouml; system.</para>

    <!-- New project -->

    <sect2 id="s2.ref.menu_new">
      <title><guiicon><inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata

        </imageobject></inlinemediaobject></guiicon> New&hellip;</title>

      <para>Shortcut Ctrl-N.</para>

      <para>This initializes a new project within &argouml;. The project is
        created with the name <literal>untitledModel</literal> and with two
        empty diagrams: a class diagram and a use case diagram.</para>

      <note><para>Although the entry is named <literal>New&hellip;</literal>
        there is no dialog&mdash;the project is just created. The entry should
        properly be just <literal>New</literal>.</para></note>

      <caution><para><literal>untitledModel</literal> is not a valid model
        name (upper case is not permitted). See <xref linkend="s1.ref.model"/>
        for a discussion of this.</para></caution>

    <!-- Open existing project -->

        Project&hellip;</title>
 
      <para>Shortcut Ctrl-O.</para>

      <para>This opens an existing project. Selecting this menu option will
        open a file selection dialog (see
        <xref linkend="fig.ref.menu_open_project"/>).</para>

          </imageobject>

          <textobject>
            <para>A file selection diagram showing directory selector; buttons
            to move up a directory, go to home directory, create a new
            director, change between list and details representations; filtered
            directory contents; filename text box; filename filter; and buttons
            to open and cancel.</para>
          </textobject>
        </mediaobject></screenshot>
      </figure>

      <para>At the top of the dialog is a drop down selector labeled
        <literal>Look&nbsp;in:</literal>, specifying the currently selected
        directory preceded by the folder icon,
        <guiicon><inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata
          format="GIF" align="center" fileref="images/icons/folder.gif"/>
        </imageobject></inlinemediaobject></guiicon>. The drop down selector
        gives access to all directories above this directory.</para>

      <para>Next to this are four icons:
        <guiicon><inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata
          format="GIF" align="center" fileref="images/icons/up_directory.gif"/>
        </imageobject></inlinemediaobject></guiicon> to move up a directory;
        <guiicon><inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata
          format="GIF" align="center" fileref="images/icons/home.gif"/>
        </imageobject></inlinemediaobject></guiicon> to select the users home
        directory,
        <guiicon><inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata
          format="GIF" align="center" fileref="images/icons/list_files.gif"/>
        </imageobject></inlinemediaobject></guiicon> to specify that a simple
          file list is displayed; and 
        <guiicon><inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata
          format="GIF" align="center"
          fileref="images/icons/details_files.gif"/>
        </imageobject></inlinemediaobject></guiicon> (which is always grayed
          out) that would show details of all files if enabled.</para>

      <para>The main body of the dialog is a text area with a listing of all
        files in the currently selected directory which match the current
        filter (see below). If these will not all fit on the display,
        scroll bars are provided to move up and down.</para>

      <para>In the lower portion of the dialog is a text box labeled
        <literal>File&nbsp;name:</literal> for the name of the file to be
        opened. The file name may be typed directly in here, or selected from
        the directory listing above using &button1; click.</para>

      <para>Beneath this is a drop down selector labeled
        <literal>Files&nbsp;of&nbsp;type:</literal> to specify a filter on the
        files to be shown in the directory listing. Only files that match the
        filter are listed. The available filters are:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>all files;</para></listitem>

        <listitem><para>zipped Argo project files (the
          default);</para></listitem>

        <listitem><para>Argo project files; and</para></listitem>

        <listitem><para>XMI format files.</para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

     <para>Argo project files are produced by earlier releases of &argouml;,
        XMI files allow you to use diagrams from other tools (which may not
        always work!).</para>

      <para>To the right of the file name and filter are two buttons,
        <literal>Open</literal> and <literal>Cancel</literal> to open the
        selected project or cancel the operation.</para>

      <note><para>Open will only succeed if a valid filename is
        provided.</para></note>

    <!-- Save project -->

      <title><guiicon><inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata

        </imageobject></inlinemediaobject></guiicon> Save Project</title>

      <para>Shortcut Ctrl-S.</para>

      <para>This saves the project using its current file name.</para>

      <note><para>A newly created project (see
        <xref linkend="s2.ref.menu_new"/>) will not have been saved to
        file. And so this entry is grayed out. Use
        <literal>Save&nbsp;Project&nbsp;As&hellip;</literal> to save the
        project to a file for the first time (see
        <xref linkend="s2.ref.menu_save_project_as"/>).</para></note>
    </sect2>

    <!-- Save project under different name -->

    <sect2 id="s2.ref.menu_save_project_as">
      <title>Save Project As&hellip;</title>

      <para>This opens a dialog allowing you to save the project under a
        different file name (or to specify a file name for the first time if
        you are a new project).</para>

      <caution><para>If you are using an experimental version of &argouml; you
        will receive a warning message that file formats are not guaranteed to
        be supported in the long term. You should be cautious about using
        unstable versions of the system for important
        projects.</para></caution>

      <para>The dialog box is identical to that for
        <literal>Open&nbsp;Project</literal> (see 
        <xref linkend="fig.ref.menu_open_project"/>). The
        <literal>Files&nbsp;of&nbsp;type:</literal> also specifies the file
        type used for saving, and you should choose a filename with the
        corresponding ending.</para>

      <tip><para>Zipped Argo Project files, ending in <literal>.zargo</literal>
        (the default) are the most efficient way of saving projects. They
        capture all the model and graphical information in a very compact
        format.</para></tip>
    </sect2>

    <!-- Import -->

    <sect2>
      <title>Import&hellip;</title>

      <para>This sub-menu provides access to mechanisms to import a variety of
        material in to &argouml;. In the current version of &argouml; only one
        type of import is provided as standard, the importing of Java code for
        reverse engineering.</para>

      <note><para>Despite being named <literal>Import&hellip;</literal> there
        is no dialog box associated with the Import menu itself (there may be
        with the sub-menu entries). It should strictly speaking be labeled
        just <literal>Import</literal> on the menu.</para></note>

      <!-- Import sources -->

      <sect3 id="s3.ref.menu_import_sources">

        <para>A very powerful feature of &argouml; is that it can

          diagram. This sub-menu entry specifies Java code to be imported for
          reverse engineering.</para>

        <para>The dialog box is very similar to that for
          <literal>Open&nbsp;Project</literal> (see
          <xref linkend="fig.ref.menu_open_project"/>), but with two extra tabs
          placed alongside the directory listing, as shown in

        <caution><para>The only file filter provided selects all files. However
          reverse engineering is currently only available, and Java source
          files only should be selected.</para></caution>

        <para>The first of the two tabs is labeled <literal>General</literal>
          and is selected by &button1; click on its tab. It provides a single
          check box
          <literal>Descend&nbsp;directories&nbsp;recursively</literal>. If
          enabled (the default), reverse engineering will track through
          sub-directories for any further Java files. If not it will restrict
          to the selected directory.</para>

        <para>The second of the two tabs is labeled <literal>Java</literal>
          and is selected by &button1; click on its tab. It provides two pairs
          of radio boxes.</para>

        <para>The first radio box allows selection between modeling attributes
          of Java classes as UML attributes (the default) or as UML
          associations to the class specified.</para>

        <para>The second radio box allows selection between modeling arrays as

    <para>This menu controls one of &argouml;'s unique features&mdash;the use

      described in Jason Robbins' PhD dissertation <ulink

      http://argouml.tigris.org/docs/robbins_dissertation/</ulink>.</para>

    <note><para>A word about terminology. The <emphasis>critics</emphasis> are
      background processes, which evaluate the current model according to
      various <quote>good</quote> design criteria. There is one critic for
      every design criterion.</para>

    <para>The output of a critic is a <emphasis>critique</emphasis>&mdash;a
      statement about some aspect of the model that does not appear to follow
      good design practice.</para>

    <para>Finally a critique will generally suggest how the bad design issue it

      </itemizedlist>

      <para>To the right of the list are a series of fields giving detailed
        control over individual critics. Selecting a critic in the list on the
        left will populate the fields for that critic.</para>

      <warning><para>In the current release of &argouml; there is a known
        problem with the user interface. When moving down through the list
        (i.e. selecting a critic below the previously selected one) the fields
        are populated for the previously selected critic. To get the fields for
        the desired critic, another critic further down must be selected,
        making the desired critic the <quote>previous critic</quote> whose
        details will then populate the fields on the right.</para>

      <para>Selecting items further up the list (i.e. selecting a critic
        <emphasis>above</emphasis> the previously selected on) does not have
        this problem.</para>

      <para>A consequence of the different behavior when selecting up or down
        is that the last critic on the list
        (<literal>Make&nbsp;Edge&nbsp;More&nbsp;Visible</literal>) can never
        populate the fields on the right.</para></warning>

      <para>The fields on the right are titled <literal>Critic Class:</literal>
        and then the full name of the class in &argouml; that implements the
        critic.</para>

      <para>The first field below this title is a text box labeled
        <literal>Headline:</literal> giving the complete headline of the critic
        (which may be truncated in the list on the left).</para>

      <note><para>In the headline you may see the text
        <literal>&lt;ocl&gt;self&lt;/ocl&gt;</literal>, which will be replaced
        by the name of the artifact in question when the critic is
        triggered.</para></note>

      <para>The next field is a drop-down selector, labeled
        <literal>Priority:</literal>. The three options available are
        <literal>High</literal>, <literal>Medium</literal> and
        <literal>Low</literal> and specify the priority category of any to-do
        item generated by this critic.</para>

      <para>The next field is labeled <literal>MoreInfo:</literal> and
        contains a URL pointing to further information with a button to the
        right labeled <literal>Go</literal> to take you to that URL.</para>

      <caution><para>In the current release of &argouml; there is no further
        information available, and the <literal>Go</literal> button is always
        grayed out and disabled.</para></caution>

      <para>The next field is labeled <literal>Description:</literal> and is a
        text area with a detailed explanation of what this critic means. If the
        text is too large for the area a scroll bar is provided to the
        right.</para>

      <note><para>In this text area you may see the text
        <literal>&lt;ocl&gt;self&lt;/ocl&gt;</literal>, which will be replaced
        by the name of the artifact in question when the critic is
        triggered.</para></note>

      <para>The last field is a drop-down selector labeled
        <literal>Use&nbsp;Clarifier</literal>, with three options,
        <literal>Always</literal>, <literal>If&nbsp;Only&nbsp;One</literal> and
        <literal>Never</literal>.</para>

      <para>Clarifiers are the icons and wavy red underlines drawn on the
        actual diagrams to indicate the a critic has triggered. The original
        intention was to make the mapping from critics to clarifiers to
        somewhat customizable.</para>

      <para>For example one user might make a <literal>Missing Name</literal>
        critic show a red underline, another user might turn off the clarifier,
        or have it draw a wavy green underline or a blue questionmark.  Critics
        with their clarifier's disabled would still produce feedback that is
        listed in the to-do pane.</para>

      <caution><para>In the current release of &argouml; this selector has no
        function, beyond printing a message on the console. It is for future
        development.</para></caution>

      <para>Underneath the fields are three buttons in a horizontal row.</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para><literal>Wake</literal>. It is possible to snooze a
          critic from the to-do pane (see <xref linkend="ch.ref.todopane"/>),
          which makes the critic inactive for a period. If the critic has been
          snoozed, this button is enabled and will wake the critic back up
          again. Otherwise it is grayed out.</para>

        <tip><para>You can tell a snoozed critic, because in the list on the
          left it will have the box in the first column checked, but will be
          shown as inactive in the third column.</para></tip></listitem>

        <listitem><para><literal>Configure</literal>. This button is for
          configuring the critic.</para>

        <caution><para>In the current version of &argouml; this function is not
          implemented, and this button is always grayed out. It is for future
          development.</para></caution></listitem>

        <listitem><para><literal>Edit Network</literal>. Right now critics are
          implemented in java code. That means end-users cannot add new
          critics.</para>

        <para>The idea of a critic network is that they would be a state
          machine like diagram with several steps.  Each step would have
          condition that together defined the <quote>rule</quote> that the
          critic is providing.  If the rule fires, then remaining steps would
          define the steps of the wizard to help the user fix the
          problem.</para>

        <para>The ideas behind this are discussed in Chapter 4 of Jason Robbins
          PhD disseration (<ulink
          url="http://argouml.tigris.org/docs/robbins_dissertation/diss4.html">
          http://argouml.tigris.org/docs/robbins_dissertation/diss4.html</ulink>.
          In particular look at Figure 1-6 in this chapter and the related
          discussion.</para>

        <para>A suggested implementation is that the conditions could be
          written in OCL against the UML meta-model.  A library of predefined
          conditins and steps would allow end-users to build new critics by
          combining those in novel ways.</para>

        <caution><para>In the current version of &argouml; this function is not
          implemented, and this button is always grayed out. It is for future
          development.</para></caution></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Finally the bottom right of the dialog contains a button labeled
        <literal>OK</literal>. &Button1; click here dismisses the
        dialog.</para>
