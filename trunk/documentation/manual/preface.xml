  <title>Preface</title>

  <para>Software design is a cognitively challenging task. Designers must
    manually enter designs, but the primary difficulty is decision-making
    rather than data-entry. If designers improved their decision-making
    capabilities, it would result in better designs.</para>

  <para>Current CASE tools provide automation and graphical user interfaces
    that reduce the manual work of entering a design and transforming a design
    into code. They aid designers in decision-making mainly by providing
    visualization of design diagrams and simple syntactic checks. Also many
    CASE tools provide substantial benefits in the area of version control and
    concurrent design mechanisms. One area of design support that has been not
    been well supported is analysis of design decisions.</para>

  <para>Current CASE tools are usable in that they provide a GUI that allows
    designers to access all the features provided by the tool. And they support
    the design process in that they allow the designer to enter diagrams in the
    style of popular design methodologies. But they typically do not provide
    process support to guide the designer through the design task. Instead,
    designers typically start with a blank page and must remember to cover
    every aspect of the design.</para>

  <para>&argouml; is a domain-oriented design environment that provides
    cognitive support of object-oriented design. &argouml; provides some of the
    same automation features of a commercial CASE tool, but it focuses on
    features that support the cognitive needs of designers. These cognitive
    needs are described by three cognitive theories:
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem><para>reflection-in-action;</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>opportunistic design; and</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>comprehension and problem solving.</para></listitem>
    </orderedlist>
  </para>

  <para>&argouml; is based directly on the UML 1.3 specification. In fact, a
    large part of &argouml; was generated automatically from the UML
    specification. &argouml; is (to the best of our knowledge) the only tool
    that implements the UML meta-model exactly as specified. In contrast,
    current commercial tools use tools use basically the same internal
    representation of the design that they used in previous versions.</para>

  <para>Furthermore, it is our goal to provide comprehensive support for OCL
    (the Object Constraint Language) and XMI (the XML Model Interchange
    format), which other tools currently do not support.</para>

  <para>&argouml; was originally developed by a small group of people as a
    research project.  &argouml; has many features that make it special, but it
    does not implement all the features that commercial CASE tools
    provide.</para>

  <para>The current developer release of ArgoUML implements all the diagram
    types of the <ulink
      url="http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/formal/uml.htm">
    UML&nbsp;1.3 standard</ulink>. It is written in Java and runs on every
    platform with a Java 1.2 (or newer) port being available.  It uses the open
    fileformats <ulink
      url="http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/formal/xmi.htm">XMI 
    </ulink> (XML Metadata Interchange format) (for model information) and
    <ulink url="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/NOTE-PGML">PGML</ulink> (Portable
    Graphics Markup Language) (for graph information) for storage. A new
    fileformat with graphs embedded as <ulink
      url="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-SVG-20001102/index.html">SVG </ulink>
    (Scalable Vector Graphics) in the XMI is in discussion, but is postponed
    until a standard for such a fileformat is defined by the <ulink
      url="http://www.omg.org">OMG</ulink> (Object Management Group).</para>

  <para>This manual is the cumulative work of several people. In addition to
    new material by the current author, Jeremy Bennett, it includes
    material from earlier versions by Aljandro Ramirez, Philippe
    Vanpeperstraete and Andreas Rueckert, from the developers cookbook by
    Markus Klink and Linus Tolke, the Quick Guide by Kunle Odutola and the FAQ
    by Dennis Daniels. And of course the review comments of users and
    developers too many to name.</para>

  <para>&argouml; is available for free and can be used in commercial
    settings. For terms of use, see the license agreement presented when you
    download &argouml;.  We are providing the source code for &argouml; for you
    to review, customize to your needs, and improve.  Over time, we hope that
    &argouml; will evolve into a powerful and useful tool for everyone to
    use.</para>

  <para>This User Manual is aimed at the working designer, who wishes to make
    use of &argouml;. In its current incarnation, it assumes familiarity with
    UML, but eventually it will support those new to UML.</para>

  <para>The &argouml; project welcomes those who want to get more
    involved. Look at the <ulink url="http://argouml.tigris.org/">project
    website</ulink> to find out more.</para>

  <para>Finally tell us what you think about this User Manual. Your comments
    will help us improve things. Email your thoughts to the
    <ulink url="mailto:users@argouml.tigris.org">&argouml; Users Mailing
      List</ulink>.</para>
