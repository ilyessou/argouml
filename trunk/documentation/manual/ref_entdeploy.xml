<chapter id="chrefentdeploy">
  <title>&argouml; Deployment Diagram Entity Reference</title>

  <sect1>
    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>This chapter describes each entity that can be created within a
      Deployment Diagram. Note that some subentities of entities on the diagram
      may not actually themselves appear on the diagram.</para>

    <para>There is a close relationship between this material and the
      Properties Tab of the Details Pane (see
      <xref linkend="s1refproptab"/>). That section covers Properties in
      general, in this chapter they are linked to specific entities.</para>

    <para>Of particular importance are the sections on Property Toolbars (see
      <xref linkend="s2refproptoolbar"/>) and Common Property Sheet Features
      (see <xref linkend="s2refpropcommonfeat"/>). These document the toolbar
      buttons and key features that are common to most Property Sheets.</para>

    <!-- A diagram to show all things visible on the diagram -->

    <para><xref linkend="figrefentdeploy"/> shows a Deployment Diagram with all
      possible entities displayed.</para>

    <!-- This should be a comprehensive picture. In fact its just the minimum
         at the moment. It would be good to put some bubbles on this one
         pointing things out as well. -->
