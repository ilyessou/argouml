          <para>The ArgoUML Navigator Pane. A rectangular pane, with a bar at
            the top, in which a drop down selection indicates this is a
            <literal>Package-centric</literal> view. The remainder of the
            pane shows a hierarchical listing. The first item is
            <literal>untitledModel</literal>, and beneath it are two
            children, <literal>class&nbsp;diagram&nbsp;1</literal> and
            <literal>use&nbsp;case&nbsp;diagram&nbsp;1</literal>. A scrollbar
            appears on the right should the view be to large for the Pane (not
            shown in this example).</para>
