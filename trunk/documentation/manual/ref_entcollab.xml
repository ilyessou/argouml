<chapter id="ch.ref.entcollab">
  <title>&argouml; Collaboration Diagram Artifact Reference</title>

  <sect1>
    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>This chapter describes each artifact that can be created within a
      Collaboration Diagram. Note that some sub-artifacts of artifacts on the
      diagram may not actually themselves appear on the diagram.</para>

    <para>There is a close relationship between this material and the
      Properties Tab of the Details Pane (see
      <xref linkend="s1.ref.proptab"/>). That section covers Properties in
      general, in this chapter they are linked to specific artifacts.</para>

    <!-- A diagram to show all things visible on the diagram -->

    <para><xref linkend="fig.ref.entcollab"/> shows a Collaboration Diagram with
      all possible artifacts displayed.</para>

    <!-- This should be a comprehensive picture. In fact its just the minimum
         at the moment. It would be good to put some bubbles on this one
         pointing things out as well. -->
