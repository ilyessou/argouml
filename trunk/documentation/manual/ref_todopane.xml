    <para>A selector box at the top allows a choice of how the data is

      <title>&Button1; Click</title>

      <para>This action is generally used to select an item for subsequent

      <para>Within the hierarchical display, elements which have

      <para>&Button1; click over the headline of any to-do item will cause its

      <para>When applied to a headline, &button1; double click will show the

  <!-- How the information is presented -->

  <sect1>
    <title>Presentation Selection</title>

    <para>At the top of the pane is a drop-down selector controlling how the
      to-do items are presented. The to-do items may be presented in six
      different ways. 
      This setting is not stored persistently, <!-- TODO: See issue ... -->
      i.e. it is on its default vallue when &argouml; is started.
    </para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para><literal>By Priority</literal>. 
        This is the default setting. 
        The to-do items are
        organized into three hierarchies by priority: <literal>High</literal>,
        <literal>Medium</literal> and <literal>Low</literal>. The priority
        associated with the to-do items generated by a particular critic may be
        altered through the
        <literal>Critique&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Browse&nbsp;Critics&hellip;</literal>
        menu (see <xref linkend="s2.ref.menu_browse_critics"/>).
      </para></listitem>

      <listitem><para><literal>By Decision</literal>. The to-do items are
        organized into 17 hierarchies by design issue:
        <literal>Uncategorized</literal>,
        <literal>Class&nbsp;Selection</literal>, 
        <literal>Behavior</literal>,
        <literal>Naming</literal>,
        <literal>Storage</literal>, 
        <literal>Inheritance</literal>,
        <literal>Containment</literal>,

        <literal>Design&nbsp;Patterns</literal>,
        <literal>Relationships</literal>, 
        <literal>Instantiation</literal>,
        <literal>Modularity</literal>, 
        <literal>Expected&nbsp;Usage</literal>,
        <literal>Methods</literal>, 
        <literal>Code&nbsp;Generation</literal> and
        <literal>Stereotypes</literal>. 
        The details of the critics in each
        category are discussed in <xref linkend="s2.ref.menu_design_issues"/>.
      </para></listitem>

      <listitem><para><literal>By Goal</literal>. &argouml; has a concept that
        critics may be grouped according to the user goals they affect. This
        presentation groups the to-do items into hierarchies by goal.</para>

      <caution><para>In the current release of &argouml; there is only one
        goal, <literal>Unspecified</literal> and all to-do items will appear
        under this heading.</para></caution></listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><literal>By Offender</literal>. The to-do items are
          organized into a hierarchy according to the artifact that caused the
          problem. Todo items that were manually created 
          with the "New ToDo item" button (i.e. not by a critic),
          are not listed here.
        </para>

        <!--caution>
          <para>
            In the V0.12 release of &argouml; collaboration and
            sequence diagrams which generate to-do items sometimes appear with
            internal package reference names, rather than their given
            name.
          </para>
        </caution-->
        <!-- TODO: Check if this is still true ... -->
        <!-- TODO: And they are not inmediately updated 
        when the name of the offender is changed. See issue ...  -->
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><literal>By Poster</literal>. The to-do items are
          organized into a hierarchy according to which critic generated the
          to-do item.
          The
          class name of the critic is listed instead of just its headline
          name since the former is guaranteed to be a unique name.
        </para>
        <!-- TODO: And where the critic name is supposed to be, 
        for a manually created todo item, 
        nothing is shown. And the details pane text is missing. 
        See issue ... -->
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><literal>By Knowledge Type</literal>. &argouml; has the
          concept that a critic reflects a deficiency in a category of
          knowledge. This presentation option groups the critics according to
          their knowledge category: 
          <literal>Designer's</literal>,
          <literal>Correctness</literal>, 
          <literal>Completeness</literal>,
          <literal>Consistency</literal>, 
          <literal>Syntax</literal>,
          <literal>Semantics</literal>, 
          <literal>Optimization</literal>,
          <literal>Presentational</literal>, 
          <literal>Organizational</literal>,
          <literal>Experiencial</literal> and
          <literal>Tool</literal>. 
          The former category (Designer's) contains the
          manually entered todo items.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </sect1>

  <!-- The item count -->

  <sect1>
    <title>Item Count</title>

    <para>To the right of the flat/hierarchical button is a count of the number
      of to-do items currently found. 
      It will be highlighted in yellow when the number of to-do items grows 
      above 50 todo items, and red when above 100.
      <!-- This is followed
      by <literal>+</literal> to indicate the last change in number was an
      increase or <literal>-</literal> to indicate the last change in number
      was a decrease.-->
      <!-- TODO: Apparently, this does not work any more. See issue ... -->
