		<title>Installation options</title>		
		<para>
			Now that you have a computer that can install and run ArgoUML effectively, you need to decide which 
			of the installation options available is appropriate for you. You can choose from the following options:

			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>
Java Web Start
</para>
					<para>
This alternative is good for occasional users and tests.
It is the easiest and quickest way to start using ArgoUML.
It requires connection to the &argo-homepage;.
					</para>
					<orderedlist>
						<listitem>
							<para>
Make sure you have 
<ulink url="http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/">
Java Web Start
</ulink>
installed.
</para>
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							<para>
Follow the Launch ArgoUML-link from the &argo-homepage;.
</para>
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							<para>
ArgoUML will be downloaded, cached locally and started.
</para>
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							<para>
On subsequent starts, the ArgoUML is available also from the
Java Web Start console 
(even without being connected to the internet)
and (if connected) at each start the version is checked
against that on the web server and updates are automatically
downloaded.
</para>
						</listitem>
					</orderedlist>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
Binary distribution
</para>
					<para>
This is good for regular users and guarantees that the
version of ArgoUML cannot change during the course of your project.
</para>
					<orderedlist>
						<listitem>
							<para>
Make sure that you have a Java 2 JRE installed.
</para>
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							<para>
Download the ArgoUML binary distribution from the &argo-homepage;.
</para>
							<para>
This could also include copying it to and from floppy disks or CD's
in order to get it to the computer if no network connection is
available.
</para>
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							<para>
Create an ArgoUML installation directory.
</para>
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							<para>
Change the current directory 
to the ArgoUML installation directory and 
extract the ArgoUML files to the installation directory.
<!--:
								<computeroutput>
jar xvf <replaceable>ArgoUML-archive-filename</replaceable>
								</computeroutput>
							</para>
							<para>
Remember to use <command>jar</command> to do this.
For some odd reason WinZIP might have problems with the 
ArgoUML zip-files. -->
							</para>

						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							<para>
Start by running the <filename>argouml.jar</filename> file, 
either by simply (double-)clicking on the file, 
or by executing the following command:
								<computeroutput>
java -jar argouml.jar
								</computeroutput>
                at the command line, or via a batch-file.
</para>

    <title>Installing Auxiliary Modules</title>
    <para>
      The standard installation of ArgoUML does not support C++, php and C# code
      generation. To make this possible, you need to download the 
      <literal>auxiliary modules</literal> 
      from the download page at the ArgoUML website.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      Unpack the downloaded file in the same directory as 
      you unpacked ArgoUML itself.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      The result should be that the directory that contains the
      <filename>argouml.jar</filename> file, now also contains a subdirectory
      named <filename>ext</filename>, which contains the
      <filename>.jar</filename> files for the extra languages.
    </para>
  </sect1>
  
  <sect1>
    <title>Command Line Options</title>
    
    <para>When starting ArgoUML from a command line, 
    there are several extra possibilities.
    Try typing:</para>

    <para><command>java -jar argouml.jar -help</command>
    </para>

    <para>You will see the instructions:</para>

    <programlisting><![CDATA[
Usage: [options] [project-file]
Options include:
  -help           display this information
  -big            use big fonts
  -huge           use huge fonts
  -nosplash       don't display logo at startup
  -noedem         don't report usage statistics
  -nopreload      don't preload common classes
  -norecentfile   don't reload last saved file
  -command <arg>  command to perform on startup
  -batch          don't start GUI
  -locale <arg>   set the locale (e.g. 'en_GB')

You can also set java settings which influence the behaviour of ArgoUML:
  -Xms250M -Xmx500M  [makes ArgoUML reserve more memory for large projects]]]>
    </programlisting>
	
	<para> A common problem is that the User Interface is shown in the wrong language. 
	  Below is an easy way to switch back to the English UI. 
	  Please beware: the language is in lowercase.
	</para>
 
    <para><command>java -jar argouml.jar -locale en</command>
    </para>

	<para> ArgoUML may be run without UI, in batch mode. 
	  Currently the possibilities are very limited. 
	  Below is an example (everything on 1 line!): 
	  It reads a "test.zargo" from my working directory, 
	  gets the diagram named "A", 
	  and writes a PNG graphical file for this diagram. 
	  Without the "-batch", 
	  ArgoUML would start up the UI after executing the commands. 
	</para>
 
    <para><command>java -jar argouml.jar -batch -command "org.argouml.uml.ui.ActionOpenProject=c:\Documents and Settings\Michiel\My Documents\test.zargo" -command org.argouml.ui.cmd.ActionGotoDiagram=A -command "org.argouml.uml.ui.ActionSaveGraphics=c:\Documents and Settings\Michiel\My Documents\test.PNG"</command>

      </authorgroup>
    </sect1info>
    <para>
This works only if you have installed using the binary distribution.
</para>
    <para>
First, find a Zargo file, and right-click on it.
You should get the normal Windows menu, including an Open or Open With option.
At this point, give a description for the file like "ArgoUML Model", 
and tell Windows to use Notepad to open the file.
That's not what you want to do ultimately, but it does get Windows to
accept the .zargo extension as representing a valid file type.
</para>
    <para>
Now, open Windows Explorer and from the menu select View->Options 
(or on Windows XP: Tools->Folder Options...). 
You
should get a two (or more) tabbed dialog. Click the "File Types" dialog, and
then scroll through the list for the Description you gave - in the example
"ArgoUML Model". Click to select that file type, and then click the "Edit"
button.
</para>
    <para>
Now, click on the "Open" action and then the "Edit" button there. You will
then get a dialog that has a line for entering in the application action
which will have a line for using Notepad to open the file. Replace that line
with:
<command>
"C:\Program Files\Java\j2re1.4.0_01\bin\javaw.exe" -jar "c:\ArgoUML\argouml.jar" "%L"
</command>
</para>
    <para>
Substitute your path to your <filename>javaw.exe</filename> and 
<filename>argouml.jar</filename> files if they are 
in a different location.
Click OK, then click OK, then click OK (three buttons on
three different levels of the dialog).
</para>
<para>The %L in the above commandline is needed instead of %1 
because that is the way to
support filename extensions of more than 3 characters.
</para>
