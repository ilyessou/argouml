		<title>Installation options</title>		
		<para>
			Now that you have a computer that can install and run &argo; effectively, you need to decide which 
			of the installation options available is appropriate for you. You can choose from the following options:
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>
Java Web Start
</para>
					<para>
This alternative is good for occasional users and tests.
It is the easiest and quickest way to start using &argo;.
It requires connection to the &argo-homepage;.
					</para>
					<orderedlist>
						<listitem>
							<para>
Make sure you have 
<ulink url="http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/">
Java Web Start
</ulink>
installed.
</para>
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							<para>
Follow the Launch ArgoUML-link from the &argo-homepage;.
</para>
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							<para>
ArgoUML will be downloaded, cached locally and started.
</para>
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							<para>
On subsequent starts, the ArgoUML is available also from the
Java Web Start console and at each start the version is checked
against that on the web server and updates are automatically
downloaded.
</para>
						</listitem>
					</orderedlist>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
Binary distribution
</para>
					<para>
This is good for regular users and guarantees that the
version of &argo; cannot change during the course of your project.
</para>
					<orderedlist>
						<listitem>
							<para>
Make sure that you have a Java 2 JRE installed.
</para>
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							<para>
Download the &argo; binary distribution from the &argo-homepage;.
</para>
							<para>
This could also include copying it to and from floppy disks or CD's
in order to get it to the computer if no network connection is
available.
</para>
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							<para>
Create an &argo; installation directory.
</para>
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							<para>
Change the current directory 
to the &argo; installation directory and 
extract the &argo; files to the installation directory:
								<computeroutput>
jar xvf <replaceable>&argo;-archive-filename</replaceable>
								</computeroutput>
							</para>
							<para>
Remember to use <command>jar</command> to do this.
For some odd reason WinZIP might have problems with the 
&argo; zip-files.
							</para>

						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							<para>
Start by running the <filename>argouml.jar</filename> file, 
either by simply (double-)clicking on the file, 
or by executing the following command:
								<computeroutput>
java -jar argouml.jar
								</computeroutput>
</para>

    <title>Making .zargo-file clickable (on Windows)</title>

        </author>
      </authorgroup>
    </sect1info>
    <para>
This works only if you have installed using the binary distribution.
</para>
    <para>
First, find a Zargo file, and right-click on it.
You should get the normal Windows menu, including an Open or Open With option.
At this point, give a description for the file like "ArgoUML Model", 
and tell Windows to use Notepad to open the file.
That's not what you want to do ultimately, but it does get Windows to
accept the .zargo extension as representing a valid file type.
</para>
    <para>
Now, open Windows Explorer and from the menu select View->Options 
(or on Windows XP: Tools->Folder Options...). 
You
should get a two (or more) tabbed dialog. Click the "File Types" dialog, and
then scroll through the list for the Description you gave - in the example
"ArgoUML Model". Click to select that file type, and then click the "Edit"
button.
</para>
    <para>
Now, click on the "Open" action and then the "Edit" button there. You will
then get a dialog that has a line for entering in the application action
which will have a line for using Notepad to open the file. Replace that line
with:
<command>
"C:\Program Files\Java\j2re1.4.0_01\bin\javaw.exe" -jar "c:\ArgoUML-0.10\argouml.jar" "%L"
</command>
</para>
    <para>
Substitute your path to your JavaW.exe and ArgoUML.jar files if they aren't
where I have them.
Click OK, then click OK, then click OK (three buttons on
three different levels of the dialog).
</para>
<para>The %L in the above commandline is needed instead of %1 
because that is the way to
support filename extensions of more than 3 characters.
</para>
