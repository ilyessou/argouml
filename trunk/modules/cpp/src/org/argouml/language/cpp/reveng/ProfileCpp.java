 * The UML profile for C++. This might also take the form of an UML model, but,

 * 
 * TODO: should extend <code>org.argouml.uml.Profile</code>, but, I don't
 * really understand what is attempted there...
 * 
 * TODO: discuss with Daniele what to do about this problem. Both the generator
 * and the importer must use the same profile, if not we are going to make
 * future RTE very difficult. Also, the users of the module are going to be
 * confused. The main point in favor of this is that there is no open source UML
 * profile for C++. Lets be pioneers here ;-)
 * 
 * About the profile being a UML model: this class could be serializable into an
 * ArgoUML model, using its model subsystem. This would be a simple way to offer
 * the user the functionality of applying the C++ profile into a model he is
 * working on!
