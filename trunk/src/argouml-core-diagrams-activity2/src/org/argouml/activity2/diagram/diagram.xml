   This file defines the types of diagram elements to be made available in
   the UML2 activity diagram.
   
   Each element within the diagram "root" element represents a toolbar button
   that will be made available to the user. Elements within the toolbar can be
   grouped with the "dropdown" element to place thjem within a dropdown
   toolbutton.
   
   The other element types indicates the representation used to display
   diagram element when it is created.
   
   poly-edge - an edge two join two nodes, the edge can be multiple parts
               (essentially an unconnected polygon)
   rect - a rectangular node
   rrect - a rectangular node with rounded corners
   pentagon - a pentagon that is formed by a combined rectangle and a triangle much
               like a direction sign on a signpost. If the concave attribute
               is set the triangle forms a notch into the rectangle.
   connector - A connection point required for some nodes.
