/**
 * This class defines an item that can be placed on a Checklist.
 * This is a short piece of text to prompt the designer to think of a
 * specific design issue.  CheckItems are similar to critics in that
 * they are categorized to be relevant to issues the designer is
 * interested in, they have a guarding condition that returns true if
 * the CheckItem should be presented, and they have a piece of text
 * as design feedback. They are different in that their predicate is
 * almost always the constant 'true', and the feedback they provide
 * is much simpler.
 *
 * CheckItems are part of Checklists.  And Checklists are registered
 * with the CheckManager.
 *
 * If you have a piece of advice you would like to give a designer,
 * you can implement it as a CheckItem _very_ easily.  If you can
 * formalize the advice more, you can implement it as a Critic.
