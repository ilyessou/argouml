<!-- Description of the package itself -->

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<h3>Interfaces</h3>

<p>This package defines no interfaces.</p>

<h3>Classes</h3>

<p>The key classes are:<p>

<ul>
  <li><p>{@link org.argouml.cognitive.Agency}. The central class
    controlling the critics.</p></li>

  <li><p>{@link org.argouml.cognitive.Critic}. The main class for
    defining critics. Specializations include {@link
      org.argouml.cognitive.CompoundCritic} for critics built out of
    several other critics and {@link org.argouml.uml.cognitive.critics.CrUML}
    for critics relating specifically to UML.</p></li>
    
  <li><p>{@link org.argouml.cognitive.ControlMech}. A control mech is 
  	used by the agency to control when a critic is active or not. We use the
  	standard mech.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>A number of other classes are provided to support these classes&mdash;see
the individual classes for more details.</p>

<p>This package also contains critics relating to the overall use of
ArgoUML. Each critic has its own class, with naming of the form
