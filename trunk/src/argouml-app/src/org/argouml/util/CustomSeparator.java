/**
 * Base class for custom separators.
 *
 * <p>It can be instantiated directly, and then works like a separator in the
 * delimiter string. For that purpose you should use the delimiter string
 * in MyTokenizer, unless your token is wider than 32 characters.
 *
 * <p>You can also subclass this class to provide for more intricate recogition
 * of the tokens. It is known that this class has been subclassed to recognize
 * quoted strings, and balanced parentheses.
 *
 * <p>You should have this mental image of the tokenizing process:<nl>
 * <li>Reset is called.
 * <li>For each character, c, in the sequence being tokenized:<ul>
 *     <li>addChar(c) is called for each separator in the tokenizer.
 *     <li>if addChar returns true, break.</ul>
 * <li>hasFreePart is checked to see if something follows. If true:<ul>
 *     <li>endChar(c) is called for each following character.
 *     <li>if/when endChar returns true, break.</ul>
 * <li>tokenLength is checked to see how far back in the sequence the token
 *     begun. If there are characters before that but after the last token,
 *     then they are made a token and this token is saved and returned next.
 * </nl>
