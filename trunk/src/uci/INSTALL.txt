Notes on how to install and compile the UCI Graph Editing Framework
source code.


================================================================
Basic steps:

1. Unzip or untar the source code archive and you will have the
following directory structure:

<somepath>
        |--uci
             |-- graphedit
             |-- util

Where <somepath> is the place in your directory structure where you
unpacked the files.

2. In your development environment set the CLASSPATH environment
variable so that it includes <somepath>.

3. If you are using Cafe, add all the .java files to your project.

4. Compile, or run make. 

5. If you are on Solaris, run the Makefile in the uci directory with
no options. You may have to edit uci/Makefile.config to
set the proper paths for your java executables.

The UCI Graph Editing Framework has been successfully compiled on
+ Sun's JDK 1.0.2 on SunOS 5.5 on a Sperc 4.
+ Symantec's Cafe 1. on a PC under Windows95.

================================================================
To make your own copy of the javadoc documentation on Solaris run:
javadoc uci.graphedit uci.util uci.graphedit.demo uci.graphedit.contrib

On my system, javadoc exits with the message "Abort". I think this is
because it runs out of memory. The fix is to modify the last line of
the javadoc shell script from this:

eval exec $JAVA_HOME/bin/java $opts -ms8m \
-verbosegc sun.tools.javadoc.Main $args

to this:

eval exec $JAVA_HOME/bin/java $opts -ms16m -ss2m \
-verbosegc sun.tools.javadoc.Main $args

Doing so will give more memory to javadoc and allow the html files to
be generated.


================================================================

This is just a very initial version of these instructions. If you have
trouble installing or if you are using a different development
environment, please let me know so that I can include any needed steps
in the next version of this file. Email jrobbins@ics.uci.edu.
