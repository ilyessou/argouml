<H1>ArgoUML in Google's Summer Of Code 2006</H1>

<p>
The ArgoUML project is, for the first time during 2006, 
attempting to take part in
<a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Google's Summer of Code</a>.
</p>

<p>
We are primarily looking for students interested in 
Software Engineering or Systems Engineering,
tools for Software Engineering, and
communication within a Software Engineering project using UML.

Java and UML are the natural prerequisites.
</p>

<p>
This page include a list of projects that are especially interesting for 2006.
Don't let this limit you.
If you have other projects in mind, let us know and we will evaluate your
ideas with the rest of the projects.
If you want you can also look at our old
<a href="jobjar.html">Job Jar</a> for inspiration.
</p>

<div class="h2">
<h2>ArgoUML performance</h2>

<p>
ArgoUML is sometimes slow and uses a lot of memory.
In the big picture this is cumbersome for the users
that need to sit and wait hours for batch operations
and in the small picture it is irritating and creates a lot of user misstakes
when popup menus and drag and drop operations take seconds to update.
It is suspected that some simple measures can be take to improve this.
</p>

<p>
This project will include:
<ul>
<li>Running ArgoUML in some performance measuring tool.
<li>Examining the result, finding areas where improvements could be done.
<li>Make the improvements.
<li>Restart.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Unless knowledge of and access to some performance measuring tool for java,
this will need to be acquired.
</p>

<div class="h2">
<h2>ArgoPrint improvements</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://argoprint.tigris.org/">ArgoPrint</a> is a tool to 
extract the information from the UML model and present it in written form
as a report.
</p>

<p>
Two things needs to be done to it.
<ul>
<li>Improve it to make it usable.
<li>Improve the template editing capabilities.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Linus Tolke will be the mentor for this.
</p>

</div>


<div class="h2">
<h2>GEF improvements</h2>
<p>
GEF is the Graph Editing Framework used by ArgoUML for rendering UML diagrams.
</p>

<p>
Four things needs to be done to it.
<ul>
<li>Complete undo facility
<li>Implement graph layout algorithms
<li>Add Eclipse compatibility
<li>Implement demonstration projects
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Bob Tarling will be the mentor for this.
