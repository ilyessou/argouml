<h1>ArgoUML Release Plan</h1>

<p>Even numbers are for stable versions.
The preceding odd second number is the corresponding not so stable version.
Example: 0.24 is a stable versions of 0.23.*. <br>
0.24.1 is a stable bug fix release of 0.24.0. <br>
Even releases are on the main branch (or extremely close to it).
The main branch is always working towards the future.</p>

<p>
Releases will only be made when there are no failing tests.
The purpose of this is to avoid any confusing discussion about
what tests were failing or are supposed to be failing and replace it
with the clear facts, if a test was
"included in a release"/"tagged with the release tag",
that test succeeded for that release.

<div class="h2">

<h2>Upcoming releases</h2>

<h3>ArgoUML release 0.26.beta1</h3>
<p>
Planned date: 2008-07-22
</p>
<p>
New Planned date: 2008-07-24
</p>
<p>
This is probably an optimistic time frame.
If all P1 issues are not solved, this will be further delayed.
If all P1 issues are solved but there are remaining P2 issues 
this will be converted to an alpha release.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Beginning of the beta period.
    From this point on, it is not allowed to commit solutions to open issues
    in the trunk for any of the involved project.
    The release manager, Linus Tolke,
    grants permission exceptions (i.e. for all commits in trunk).
    </li>

<li>A known problems list is compiled.</li>

<li>All P1 and P2 issues must be solved.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tigris site upgrade</h3>
<p>
Planned date: Monday 7/28/08 10:00 am IST
</p>
<p>
This shouldn't affect the release scripts and release work in any way
but we should never say never.
We plan at least one beta release after the upgrade to make sure.

<p>
Planned date: 2008-07-30

</ul>


<h3>ArgoUML release 0.23.1</h3>
<p>
Planned date: 2006-09-09
</p>
<ul>
  <li>First step towards a split-model repository
      (<a href="/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=3497">issue 3497</a>).

<h3>Conversion of the ArgoUML projects to Subversion</h3>
<p>
Originally Planned date: 2006-09-10 (immediately after 0.23.1)<br>
Planned date set by the staff that is actually going to do it:
2006-09-17 through 2006-09-28 depending on the project.
For details see
<a href="http://www.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=195">issue 195</a>.
</p>
<p>
There is a big risk that any uncommitted work will be lost or hard
to recover after this process so all developers shall make sure everything is
committed (at least in a working branch).
After the conversion, any checked out CVS copy is useless and should be removed
and a new check out using Subversion (SVN) is required.
