<br/>
</span><span style="FONT-STYLE:italic">Abstract</span><br/>
<br/>
UML is a <span style="FONT-STYLE:italic">de facto</span> standard in commercial
software modeling. The language provides a rich set of<br/>
constructors which enable the specification of systems ranging from simple
information systems<br/>
to sophisticated multi-threaded ones. Despite of the fact of being mainly target
to specifying<br/>
software systems the language also provides means to be adapted to other
domains, as multi-<br/>
agent systems, tests, and many others. This project aims to extend ArgoUML in
order to support<br/>
UML profiles, the proposed features include (but are not limited to):
definition, application and<br/>
management of profiles.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="FONT-STYLE:italic">Project Goals</span><br/>
<br/>
+ Support to profile projects (a profile project is just an UML project which
extends some<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; UML metaclasses)<br/>
+ Support to UML projects to use profile projects<br/>
+ Include support to profiles extending other profiles (desirable)<br/>

</span>I have already implemented a first prototype of my vision of how should<br/>
profiles be handled on ArgoUML. Take a look
