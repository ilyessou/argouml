<H1>ArgoUML in Google's Summer Of Code 2008</H1>

<p>
Google will run the 
<a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2008">Google Summer of Code 2008</a>.
The ArgoUML organization will be applying to take part once again.
</p>

<p>
This page include a list of project suggestions and
some general tips on what we look for in a student such as

<h3>Module Loader Eclipse-style</h3>
<p>
We would like to integrate the Eclipse module loader in ArgoUML.
</p>

<p>
We have had a long list of problems with the module loader and
previously reimplemented it once already.
The Eclipse project is, on the other hand, very experienced and successful
with their module loader/plug-in handler.
</p>
<p>
We assume the following challenges:
  <ul>
    <li>Remaining name resolution problems to be solved</li>
    <li>Identifying APIs</li>
    <li>All modules are built and distributed as Eclipse Plug-ins</li>
    <li>Java Web Start</li>
  </ul>

<h3>eUML model subsystem</h3>

<p style="font-weight: bold">Description:</p>
<p>
eUML is a <a href="http://argouml-stats.tigris.org/documentation/defaulthtml/cookbook/ch05.html#model">
model subsystem</a> in ArgoUML, it's the alternative to the MDR model subsystem
(the one used currently by ArgoUML, see the ArgoUML architecture in the 
<a href="http://argouml-stats.tigris.org/documentation/defaulthtml/cookbook/">Cookbook</a>).
eUML is implemented with the
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/mdt/?project=uml2">"Eclipse UML2"</a> project and
in part using the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/">Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF)</a>
project, and supports
<a href="http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/modeling_spec_catalog.htm#UML">UML 2.x</a> while
the MDR model is implemented with the <a href="http://mdr.netbeans.org/">Metadata Repository (MDR)</a>
Project and supports <a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/UML/1.4/">UML 1.4</a>.
The eUML model and the MDR model are both implementing the ArgoUML interfaces from
<a href="http://argouml-stats.tigris.org/nonav/reports-java5/javadocs-api/org/argouml/model/package-summary.html">
org.argouml.model</a>.
</p>
<p>
The eUML model is not finished:
<ul>
<li>It does not implement all the required interfaces from  org.argouml.model</li>
<li>There is new functionality in UML 2 that needs additional interfaces in  org.argouml.model
to be usable by ArgoUML's components</li>
<li>There are places where UML2 elements are changed in behavior and semantics from the previous
UML versions</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold">Improvement suggestions:</p>
<p>
Incrementally implement and improve the eUML model using the Eclipse UML2 and EMF projects.
Incrementally means that the implemented stuff from the model subsystem should be done to implement some
high level functionality in ArgoUML, eg: because you want to implement the possibility to create some
state in an activity diagram you'll implement what it requires in the model subsystem, then you could
test what you've done by testing that specific functionality in ArgoUML.
</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold">Requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Java SE</li>
<li>Basic UML knowledge</li>
<li>You will need to read the UML specification (the relevant parts of it), specifically the 
<a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/UML/2.1.2/Superstructure/PDF/">Superstructure</a></li>
<li>Basic <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/pde/">Eclipse PDE</a> knowledge - not really required, but desirable</li>
</ul>

<a name="look_for_students"><h2>The students we are looking for</h2></a>

<p>
We are looking for enthusiastic students with a solid knowledge of Java,
who are interested in software development tools and modeling,
particularly the UML modeling language.
Most, although not all, tasks will be easier for those who already
have an working knowledge of the OMG's UML.
</p>
</div>

<div class="h2">
<a name="choose_project"><h2>The projects we are looking for</h2></a>
<p>
This page include a list of suggested projects that the development team
has thought of, but we are happy to consider projects which are
not listed here.
</p>
<p>
If you'd like to suggest a different project,
please discuss it previously with the team on the developers' mailing list
so that you can develop the strongest possible proposal for
evaluation. 
</p>
<p>
There's also a more general list of development tasks which
have been suggested over time available in our 
<a href="jobjar.html">Job Jar</a> which may offer additional sources of
inspiration
and our bug database could be another source of inspiration.
</p>

<div class="h2">
<a name="application">
  <h2>How to fill in your application</h2>
</a>
<p>
In the Title, formulate your own title as a summary of what you will 
accomplish in the project.
</p>
<p>
In the Abstract, describe what you plan to achieve in the project.
</p>
<p>
In the Detailed Description,
we suggest you use more or less the following template:<pre>
* General introduction
* Your plans for the summer
* Your experience. State specifically any previous experience with:
    * ArgoUML (using or improving)
    * UML
    * Java, Eclipse
    * Open Source projects
    * Other programming languages or XML
* Details on the project you are suggesting. This includes:
    * What the project is about
    * Why this is important to ArgoUML
    * How this is solved
</pre>
</p>
<p>
In your plans for the summer,
mention where you will be working,
at home, in your student dorm, at your institution,
and what kind of computer and internet access you have access to there.
