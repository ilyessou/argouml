<h3>Module Loader Eclipse-style</h3>
<p>
We would like to integrate the Eclipse module loader in ArgoUML.
</p>

<p>
We have had a long list of problems with the module loader and
previously reimplemented it once already.
The Eclipse project is, on the other hand, very experienced and successful
with their module loader/plug-in handler.
</p>
<p>
We assume the following challenges:
  <ul>
    <li>Remaining name resolution problems to be solved</li>
    <li>Identifying APIs</li>
    <li>All modules are built and distributed as Eclipse Plug-ins</li>
    <li>Java Web Start</li>
  </ul>

  There are also
  <a href="gsoc2008/eclipse-plugin-handler.html">
    some other ideas on requirements on the implementation that could be useful.

<h3>eUML model subsystem</h3>

<p style="font-weight: bold">Description:</p>
<p>
eUML is a <a href="http://argouml-stats.tigris.org/documentation/defaulthtml/cookbook/ch05.html#model">
model subsystem</a> in ArgoUML, it's the alternative to the MDR model subsystem
(the one used currently by ArgoUML, see the ArgoUML architecture in the 
<a href="http://argouml-stats.tigris.org/documentation/defaulthtml/cookbook/">Cookbook</a>).
eUML is implemented with the
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/mdt/?project=uml2">"Eclipse UML2"</a> project and
in part using the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/">Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF)</a>
project, and supports
<a href="http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/modeling_spec_catalog.htm#UML">UML 2.x</a> while
the MDR model is implemented with the <a href="http://mdr.netbeans.org/">Metadata Repository (MDR)</a>
Project and supports <a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/UML/1.4/">UML 1.4</a>.
The eUML model and the MDR model are both implementing the ArgoUML interfaces from
<a href="http://argouml-stats.tigris.org/nonav/reports-java5/javadocs-api/org/argouml/model/package-summary.html">
org.argouml.model</a>.
</p>
<p>
The eUML model is not finished:
<ul>
<li>It does not implement all the required interfaces from  org.argouml.model</li>
<li>There is new functionality in UML 2 that needs additional interfaces in  org.argouml.model
to be usable by ArgoUML's components</li>
<li>There are places where UML2 elements are changed in behavior and semantics from the previous
UML versions</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold">Improvement suggestions:</p>
<p>
Incrementally implement and improve the eUML model using the Eclipse UML2 and EMF projects.
Incrementally means that the implemented stuff from the model subsystem should be done to implement some
high level functionality in ArgoUML, eg: because you want to implement the possibility to create some
state in an activity diagram you'll implement what it requires in the model subsystem, then you could
test what you've done by testing that specific functionality in ArgoUML.
</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold">Requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Java SE</li>
<li>Basic UML knowledge</li>
<li>You will need to read the UML specification (the relevant parts of it), specifically the 
<a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/UML/2.1.2/Superstructure/PDF/">Superstructure</a></li>

<h3>ArgoUML and uml 2 compliance level 0</h3>
<p>
<a href="#amof1">UML 2[1]</a> defines several compliance levels for uml-tools.
To fulfill the
compliance level 0, mainly classes and class-diagrams of uml 2.x must be
supported. these will be introduced to argouml by integrating a
meta-model-repository: <a href="#amof3">amof2[3]</a>.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>1st step: basic integration</dt>
<dd>
Amof2 has to be integrated into argouml's tool-library and the
build-mechanisms.
</dd>

<dt>2nd step: amof2 interface</dt>
<dd>
ArgoUML supports already two model-repositories. this is possible due to
an abstraction layer. the api from amof2 must be wrapped by this layer.
</dd>

<dt>3rd step: gui binding</dt>
<dd>
The needed ui-objects for creating, editing and deleting the level 0
objects already exist, as argouml supports their uml 1.4 siblings which
should be mostly the same on this basic level.
</dd>

<dt>4th step: persistence</dt>
<dd>
Amof2 understands xmi but can't persist files by itself. argouml's xmi
export and import interface must be connected to the xmi-reader and
-writer from amof2. also the file-format of argouml must be enabled to
save the xmi-data from the amof2-repository
</dd>

<h3>Executable UML</h3>
<p>
Make the Executable UML profile work in ArgoUML.
</p>

<p>
There are several different aspects of this.
The most important ones are thought to be:
</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Improve ArgoUML to allow a profile to add the needed restrictions
      to be able to work with the Executable UML profile.
    </li>
    <li>
      Explore OCL to see if it works well enough as an action language
      for Executable UML.
    </li>
    <li>
      Depending on the result of the OCL evaluation,
      integrate another action language geared towards Executable UML.
    </li>
    <li>
      Integrate a compiler to compile Executable UML from within
      ArgoUML with help in pin-pointing errors.
    </li>
    <li>
      Integrate/implement an interpreter that executes a model and
      visualizes states and state transitions.
    </li>
  </ul>

<h3>Improve a subsystem of your choice by solving existing issues</h3>
<p>
The issues database contains many <i>bugs</i> 
and <i>enhancement requests</i>.
Go to the query page at 
<a href="http://argouml.tigris.org/issues/query.cgi?">Issue tracking query</a>,
and select a subsystem from the list below.
</p>
<p>
The task for the student is to solve 
as much of these issues 
within one subsystem
as (s)he can.
</p>

<p> These are acceptable subsystems:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Class Diagram</li>
    <li>CodeGeneration and ReverseEngineering</li>
    <li>Collaboration Diagram</li>
    <li>Cpp module</li>
    <li>Critics</li>
    <li>Csharp module</li>
    <li>Deployment Diagram</li>
    <li>Diagrams</li>
    <li>Explorer</li>
    <li>GUI</li>
    <li>Model</li>
    <li>Model/MDR</li>
    <li>Module loader</li>
    <li>Notation</li>
    <li>OCL and Constraints</li>
    <li>Other</li>
    <li>Persistence</li>
    <li>PHP module</li>
    <li>Profiles</li>
    <li>Property Panels</li>
    <li>Sequence Diagram</li>
    <li>State and Activity Diagram</li>
    <li>Usecase Diagram</li>
</ul>

<p>
Beware: This may seem less interesting than
adding one big new feature to ArgoUML, 
but has the big advantage that 
the work is broken in many small parts, 
each of which are usefull to solve on its own.
No pressure for deadlines, 
no disappointment if a project remains unfinished!

<div class="h3">
<h3>Create "Critics" for all UML well-formedness rules</h3>
<p>
Critics are ArgoUML's system of warnings, 
i.e. when you break a rule of UML, then a warning will be generated,
much like warnings and errors used for source code correctness and style.
</p>
<p>
The UML contains the so-called "Well-formedness rules" (WFR),
written in OCL,
which specify constraints to the creation of model-elements.
</p>
<p>
ArgoUML currently contains an outdated set of critics, 
from the days we supported UML 1.3. 
These need to be updated to the UML 1.4 standard, and completed. 
</p>

<div class="h3">
<h3>Support of parameterized classes (templates)</h3>
<p>
In UML, parameterized classes are used to model parameterized types. 
This is somewhat similar to Java and C# generics and C++ templates.
ArgoUML doesn't support yet the modeling of parameterized classes and this is 
causing it to be less useful for modeling in these languages.
</p>
<p>
This project would implement the GUI support for modeling parameterized 
classes, since these are already supported in the model sub-system.
It will require working in the several presentation elements of the ArgoUML 
GUI, such as the explorer pane, the class diagram and the properties panel.
Potentially interesting is the correct display of the parameterized classes 
and of the bound elements (classes that are defined by defining actual types 
for the parameterized class' parameters).
</p>

<p>
More details on suggestion:
</p>
  <ul>
    <li>This project is 
    <a href="http://argouml.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=1446">issue 
    #1446</a>.</li>
    <li>The model sub-system support for parameterized classes are available 
    via the interfaces <code>CoreFactory</code> and <code>CoreHelper</code> 
    of the package <code>org.argouml.model</code>.
    <li>In the context of some work made previously to support the notation 
    of UML templates - the dashed rectangle in the upper right-hand corner 
    of the class symbol - it was considered interesting to explore this in the 
    scope of the <a href="http://gef.tigris.org/">GEF project</a>. 
    See <a href="http://argouml.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=3802">issue 
    #3802</a> for some reasoning and ideas related to this.</li>
    <li>A big part of this project is Java Swing work on top of GEF and 
    ArgoUML GUI classes.</li> 
    <li>The proposal mentor will work in parallel ensuring that the code 
    generation modules will also support generics or templates.
    </li>

<h3>ArgoEclipse project</h3>

<p style="font-weight: bold">Description:</p>
<p>
<a href="http://argoeclipse.tigris.org/">ArgoEclipse</a> is a project that integrates ArgoUML within the
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse IDE</a>.
ArgoUML's main panels (implemented in Swing): the explorer pane (top left), the diagram pane (top right),
the to do list pane (bottom left) and the properties pane (bottom right) are integrated in Eclipse's 
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/swt/">Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT)</a> and included in the Eclipse views, editors and dialogs
using the <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/help32/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/swt/awt/SWT_AWT.html">SWT_AWT</a>
bridge (that makes possible Swing integration into SWT).
<br/>
The Eclipse IDE can host ArgoEclipse as its plugin along with other plugins, but ArgoEclipse can also be used as a standalone 
<a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Rich_Client_Platform">Rich Client Product (RCP)</a> application.
<br/>
ArgoEclipse uses mainly ArgoUML's Swing code as is and sparsely reimplements some Swing dialogs using SWT.

<p style="font-weight: bold">Improvement suggestions:</p>
<p>
The suggestions marked with (*) are harder to accomplish.
<ul>
<li>Reimplement the Swing dialog windows from ArgoUML using SWT/JFace</li>
<li>Extend the org.eclipse.ui.PreferencesPages extension point and reimplement ArgoUML's settings</li>
<li>Headless build for the plugin and the RCP application using <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-PDE-Automation/automation.html">PDE tools</a></li>
<li>Reimplement the explorer, todo and properties panes of ArgoUML in SWT/JFace or/and redesign their appearence</li>
<li>Add the ability to parse Eclipse Java projects and generate a UML model in ArgoEclipse
(ArgoUML is able to parse Java files from a filesystem location)</li>
<li>Hook the editors/views to the standard global actions (print, delete, select all, undo, redo, etc)</li>
<li>Add action bar contributions when the editor is opened: menu contributions, coolbar contributions with ArgoUML's actions
that should be available in that context</li>
<li>(*) Add support for the ability to drag UML elements from the explorer pane and drop them on the diagram editor</li>
<li>(*) Use the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/gef/">Eclipse Graphical Editing Framework (GEF)</a>
to start the reimplementation of the diagram editor</li>
<li>(*) Implement the support for multiple diagram editors</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold">Requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic UML knowledge</li>
<li>Java SE</li>
<li>Eclipse Plugin Development Environment (PDE)</li>
<li>Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT) / JFace</li>
<li>Apache Ant scripts (this is required only if you want to include the headless build suggestion)</li>
<li>Graphical Editing Framework (GEF) (this is required only if you want to include the reimplementation of the diagram editor with GEF suggestion)</li>
