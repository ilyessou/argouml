<h1>The Design of ArgoUML</h1>
This is an attempt to use html to develop a design that we will have
as goal for ArgoUML.
<p>
This is work in progress. I havn't even added the components yet.
Please let me know what you think about the ideas...

<p>These are the components 
(how they were defined by Linus in the Cookbook autumn 2002 is the initial
attempt):
<ul>
<li><a href="comp/model.html">Model</a>
<li><a href="comp/critics.html">Critics</a>
<li><a href="comp/diagrams.html">Diagrams</a>
<li><a href="comp/propertypanels.html">Property panels</a> 
<li><a href="comp/reverseengineering.html">Reverse Engineering</a>
<li><a href="comp/codegeneration.html">Code Generation</a> 
<li><a href="comp/java.html">Java</a>
<li><a href="comp/otherlanguages.html">Other languages</a>
<li><a href="comp/guiframework.html">GUI Framework</a>
<li><a href="comp/application.html">Application</a>

<li><a href="comp/ocl.html">OCL</a>
</ul>

<h2>How we work together on this</h2>

<h3>Feedback and status</h3>
This is a work in progress for the design of ArgoUML of the future.
When things are finished and have settled down in the design 
you can start augmenting the design with the migration path from
the old to the new design.
When that migration path is completed you can start implementing the new
desing in the code.

<p>Monitor the cvs mailing list for changes to any of these files
if you want to follow the development.

<p>If you don't agree on what someone has written, change it,
unless this is the basis for a lot of other work in the design.


<h3>State of mind for this work</h3>
<UL>
<LI>If there are omissions in any document, amend it!
<LI>If you don't have the time, 
knowledge, or 
inclination
to finish 
the sentence,
the paragraph, or
the chapter
just enter a TODO:-stating what is not in place.
You can always come back later or someone else can do it.
<LI>If you don't have the possibility to edit the files,
ask someone that can to do it for you (don't ask on the mailing lists).
</UL>

<h3>Ground rules</h3>
<UL>
<LI>Everything is contained under www/design.
<LI>Use the simplest possible html!
<LI>Type setting things are banned i.e. things like fonts or styles.
(This kind of thing are added by the Tigris site so 
it will probably be a mess anyway.)
<LI>Store pictures in <a href="/design/pictures/">/design/pictures/</a>.
<LI>Commit often.
<LI>No watches. Keep text files short (never over 50KB).
</UL>
