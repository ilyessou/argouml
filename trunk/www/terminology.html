<H2>Terminology for ArgoUML</H2>
This is the Terminology for the ArgoUML project and also for the ArgoUML
product.
The purpose is to establish a common use of some words to make it easier
to understand what we are talking about.<p>

The terminology here is to be used for
<ul>
<li>All code (class names, variable names, method names)
<li>All comments throughout the code
<li>All strings in the UI (in the default language en_US)
<li>All documents (in the default language en_US)
<li>All postings to the mailing lists and all other discussions within 
the ArgoUML project.
</ul>

<H3>Words</H3>
<!-- These words are in alphabetic order -->

<dl>

<dt>Add</dt>
<dd>Add existing object to something.
</dd>

<dt>Export</dt>
<dd>Export everything or some part from an existing structure to some format.
This implies some kind of conversion involved.
</dd>

<dt>Import</dt>
<dd>Import some other format into an existing structure.
This implies that there is some kind of conversion involved and that
the already existing things are not removed.
They are either changed or left unchanged by the import.
An Export, New, Import cycle can lead to information loss because
of the two conversions involved.
