This is performed by the person that originally raised the Issue
or by the QA responsible for that area.
You need to be a member of the project (any role).
This can also be done by someone who would raise the issue but
did not because it was already present in Issuesilla.
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Pick any Issue that is Verified and that you have raised or that you
have found and refrained from raising because somebody else already
had written it.

The list of all VERIFIED issues
</a>.
</p></li><li><p>
See that you are satisfied with the solution.
This could involve reading through the resolution and 
starting the tool to verify it.
</p></li><li><p>
Do one of the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
If you are satisfied, put the Issue in Status CLOSED.
</p></li><li><p>
If you are not satisfied but the problem is solved as it is written in
the Issue, put the Issue in Status CLOSED and open a new Issue with
the rest of the problem.
</p></li><li><p>
If you are not satisfied and the problem is not solved, put the Issue
in status REOPENED with a description on what you are not satisfied
with.
