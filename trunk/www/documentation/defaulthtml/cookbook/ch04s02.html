Each subsystem that is used by other subsystems provide
two ways for other subsystems to use them:
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The Facade class
</p><p>
The use of Facade class is not wide spread in ArgoUML.
This is because ArgoUML is traditionally built as a whole
and no subsystems were clearly defined.
</p><p>
A Facade class provides the most common functions other subsystems
want to do when using that subsystems to reduce the need of having
to use anything else but the Facade class.
The Facade class should be very much more stable than the subsystem
itself.
Methods in the Facade should change really slowly and only be 
removed after several months (and one stable release) of deprecation.
</p><p>
The Facade class is documented in the class file itself (as javadoc)
and the more complex picture (if needed) is documented in the
Cookbook (in <a href="ch05.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Inside the subsystems">Chapter&nbsp;5, <i>Inside the subsystems</i></a>).
</p></li><li><p>
An API with calls to public methods in appointed classes
</p><p>
Traditionally subsystems communicate through public methods and
public variables and
the subsystems, as defined by the responsibilities,
are spread over several package setting aside the java visibility rules.
For this reason it is not well-known or documented
what public methods form part of a subsystem's API and
what public methods are internal to a subsystem.
For this reason, always exercise extreme caution when changing
the signature of a public method.
(See <a href="ch08.html#groundrules" title="8.1.&nbsp;How to work against the CVS repository">Section&nbsp;8.1, &#8220;How to work against the CVS repository&#8221;</a>.)
</p><p>
In order not to worsen things, make it very clear when adding a new
public method, if it is part of the subsystem's API or not
(in the javadoc of that method).
</p><p>
This way of communicating is still to be used when it is not
convenient to use the Facade for a specific use of that subsystem.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Notice that the Facade is normally a part of the API or 
a simplified version of the API.
</p><p>
For each subsystem X in ArgoUML that uses the subsystem Y 
the designer of the subsystem X, 
must decide if he wants to use the API of Y
when using the subsystem Y 
(putting a set of import org.argouml.Y.internals.blabla.*; statements
in each file of subsystem X that uses subsystem Y)
or use the Facade class of subsystem Y
(putting only one import org.argouml.Y.YFacade; 
in each file in the subsystem X that uses subsystem Y).
</p><p>
The API solution 
makes the subsystem X depending on the subsystem Y meaning
that when we change the API of the subsystem Y we must also change
subsystem X.
The facade calls solution
doesn't make the subsystem X depending on the API of subsystem Y
but just the Facade of subsystem Y.
</p><p>
If the API or Facade solution is used
shall be described in the Cookbook's description of subsystem X
in the list of used subsystems.
