This is what the different attributes mean and how they are used 
in the ArgoUML project.
This is to be read as an addendum to the 
<a href="http://argouml.tigris.org/project/www/docs/issue_lifecycle.html" target="_top">
Tigris definition of the resolutions
</a>
and for that reason it is not a complete list.
</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="issue_priorities"></a>11.2.1.&nbsp;Priorities</h3></div></div></div><a class="indexterm" name="d0e10916"></a><a class="indexterm" name="d0e10921"></a><p>
The priorities are used in the following manner in ArgoUML:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>P1 - Fatal error</p><p>
These issues are blockers for all releases.
</p><p>
Examples:
ArgoUML cannot start;
Crashes program, jvm or computer; and
Significant loss of user data.
</p></li><li><p>P2 - Serious error</p><p>
These issues are blockers for stable releases.
</p><p>
Examples:
Information lost.
</p></li><li><p>P3 - Not so serious error</p><p>
Examples:
Functions not working;
Strange behavior; and
Exceptions logged.
</p></li><li><p>P4 - Confusing behavior</p><p>
Examples:
Incorrect help texts and documentation;
Inconsistant behavior;
UI not updated; and
Incorrect javadoc.
</p></li><li><p>P5 - Small problems</p><p>
Examples:
Spelling errors.
Ugly icons.
Excessive logging.
Missing javadoc.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="issuezilla_resolutions"></a>11.2.2.&nbsp;Resolutions</h3></div></div></div><a class="indexterm" name="d0e10962"></a><a class="indexterm" name="d0e10967"></a><p>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>LATER</p><p>
Used to denote that a certain issue cannot be resolved until
some special upcoming and planned-for event has happened.
The event in question is noted in the target milestone.
</p><p>
Events can be things like, dropping support for a jdk version,
changing the version of UML that we support, or
replacing some central mechanism within ArgoUML.
Once they have a target milestone registered,
they are considered events.
</p></li><li><p>REMIND</p><p>
Not used.
</p><div class="sidebar"><p>
Rationale: Each issue have basically four states:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>NEW/STARTED/REOPENED - To be resolved</p></li><li><p>RESOLVED - To be verified</p></li><li><p>VERIFIED - To be closed</p></li><li><p>CLOSED - Finished.</p></li></ol></div><p>
The statistics is based on this and persons looking for 
issues to resolve look among the "To be resolved"-group
(the web pages to help in this are set up in this way).
This is also in synch with our release process.
</p><p>
Looking at it from a single persons perspective an issue is either a
"I could work with this issue but I currently don't",
"I work with this one", or
"I am now done with my work on this issue".
For a resolver this is corresponds to NEW/REOPEN for the first group,
STARTED for the second and
RESOLVED for the third.
For a verifier this corresponds to 
RESOLVED for the first group and
VERIFIED for the third group.
</p><p>
The RESOLVED/REMIND does not fit this.
They risk to be verified because the rest of our process urges
people to resolve issues that are RESOLVED
in which case they are probably lost.

They risk to be hanging in the RESOLVED state because nobody understands 
where they should go from there.

It is not clear who is responsible to move them forward.
The person that "resolved" them or someone else.
Someone risk to think that there is nothing left to do since it is resolved 
and if so his options of doing work are reduced which could lead to that 
he actually does less with ArgoUML than he else would.
</p><p>
To amend this we have made two things:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Decided that we don't use the
RESOLVED/REMIND
states.
</p></li><li><p>At every release,
as part of the release process,
clean up issues that for some mysterious reason ended up
in these states
(See <a href="ch02s08.html" title="2.8.&nbsp;Making a release">Section&nbsp;2.8, &#8220;Making a release&#8221;</a>,
<a href="ch02s08.html#issuezilla_release_maintenance">10</a>,
<a href="ch02s08.html#reopen_remind_and_later">f</a>)
</p></li></ol></div><p>
</p><p>
If you plan to solve an issue now,
assign it to you,
start it, and 
set the target milestone to the release you plan to have it solved.
This will signal to everyone that you have the responsibility,
will pursue it, and your time plan.
</p><p>
If you don't plan to solve this now,
leave it in the "up for grabs"-pile (as not resolved).
Somebody else might want to work with it.
</p><p>
If you know that an issue cannot be resolved now because it requires
that another issue is solved before,
register the other issue as "depends on" and leave the issue in the 
"up for grabs"-pile (as not resolved).
</p><p>
If you know that an issue cannot be resolved now because it requires
some big event to take place,
put the milestone for that event in the target milestone and
resolve the issue as RESOLVED/LATER.
</p></div></li><li><p>WORKSFORME</p><p>
This means that it works in a released version of ArgoUML.
State the version in the comment.
</p><p>
If the version stated by the reporter in the issue is not
the same as the version in the comment then this probably 
means that problem was fixed in some release without anyone
noticing that this problem was fixed.
