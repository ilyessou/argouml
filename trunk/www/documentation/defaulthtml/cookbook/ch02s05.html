To simplify for the person that is actually doing the release work
and to make sure that everything is done in the exact same way 
every time and nothing is forgotten,
this list of what to do when releasing is maintained.
</p><p>
It is provided with the hopes of being helpful.
If you, the release responsible, finds it unhelpful, please remove it!
</p><p>
What needs to be done when one actually does a release:
</p><p>
	</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Tag the whole CVS repository with the freeze tag!</p><p>
Normally this tag is "VERSION_<i><tt>X_Y_Z</tt></i>_F",
e.g. VERSION_0_9_7_F.
The according command line CVS command is 
<b>cvs rtag VERSION_<i><tt>X_Y_Z</tt></i>_F argouml</b>.
(Because of a problem on the Tigris site, this doesn't work, 
instead make sure you have a complete checked out copy of ArgoUML,
go to the root directory and run the command
<b>cvs tag VERSION_<i><tt>X_Y_Z</tt></i>_F argouml</b>.)
</p></li><li><p>Make sure you have a clean copy of the source!</p><p>
This is done by checking out from the tag using the command
<b>cvs co -r VERSION_<i><tt>X_Y_Z</tt></i>_F argouml_modules</b>
and
<b>cvs co -r VERSION_<i><tt>X_Y_Z</tt></i>_F argouml/tests</b>
in a new directory.
</p></li><li><p>
Build the release with <b>build dist-release</b>!
</p><p>
This is done in the 
<tt>argouml/src_new</tt>
directory.
</p><p>
The output should be the files
ArgoUML-<i><tt>VERSION</tt></i>-libs.tar.gz,
ArgoUML-<i><tt>VERSION</tt></i>-libs.zip,
ArgoUML-<i><tt>VERSION</tt></i>-src.tar.gz,
ArgoUML-<i><tt>VERSION</tt></i>-src.zip,
ArgoUML-<i><tt>VERSION</tt></i>-app.tgz,
ArgoUML-<i><tt>VERSION</tt></i>.tar.gz, and
ArgoUML-<i><tt>VERSION</tt></i>.zip
in the top-level argouml directory.

</p></li><li><p>Test the release!</p><p>
Either the tar or zip-file is tested by unpacking, starting and then
running through the test cases.
Currently there isn't any defined test cases.
</p><p>
All JUnit test cases are run by
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Run the JUnit test cases in
<tt>argouml/tests</tt>
by issueing the command
<b>build tests</b>!
</p><p>
There should not be any failed tests.
</p></li><li><p>
Run the JUnit test cases in 
<tt>modules/junit</tt>
by cd:ing to
<tt>modules/junit</tt>
and running <b>build run</b>,
invoking JUnit tests from the Tools menu,
specifying the Test Case TestAll,
and running.
No problems shall be found.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
</p><p>
If the tests did not pass See <a href="ch02s05.html#release_process_test_failed" title="2.5.1. The release did not work">Section 2.5.1</a>.
</p></li><li><p>Tag the whole repository with the release tag!</p><p>
This tag is "VERSION_<i><tt>X_Y_Z</tt></i>",
e.g. VERSION_0_9_7.
The according command line CVS command is 
<b>cvs tag VERSION_<i><tt>X_Y_Z</tt></i></b>
when your are standing in the
<tt>argouml</tt>-directory.
</p></li><li><p>
Open the repository for commits towards the next version.
</p><p>
This is done by setting the <tt>argo.core.version</tt>
in <tt>default.properties</tt> to 
<i><tt>Number of next release</tt></i>
and commiting.
</p></li><li><p>Upload the files onto the tigris website!</p><p>
Only a project owner can do that.
Please write the descriptions of the files like this:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>libraries</p><p>
libraries needed to compile
</p></li><li><p>sources</p><p>
source code without libraries
</p></li><li><p>complete set</p><p>
binary distribution, including all libraries
</p></li><li><p>application bundle</p><p>
binary distribution, runnable as application bundle
</p></li></ul></div><p>
</p></li><li><p>
Contact Jason Robbins to make the new Webstart version available!
</p><p>
Jason Robbins takes care of the signing and publishing of the
Webstart version.
</p></li><li><p>
Go through Issuezilla and check things.
</p><p>
Things to check are:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="a"><li><p>
That there is a Version created in issuezilla for the newly created release.
</p><p>
The purpose of this is to make it possible for everyone 
to report bugs on the new release.
</p></li><li><p>
Make sure that the upcoming releases have 
target milestones created for them.
</p></li><li><p>
Change the target milestones of all the non yet resolved issues 
for this release to ---.
</p></li><li><p>Other stuff.</p><p>
This can also be a good time to change all 
RESOLVED/REMIND and RESOLVED/LATER.
Search for them and Reopen them.
</p></li></ol></div></li><li><p>Make announcements!</p><p>
The announcement shall include a list of what has changed.
</p><p>
Write a News announcements and a short note on 
the dev, users and announce lists.
Announcer should make sure that he/she is already subscribed to all lists.
</p><p>
Freshmeat: currently Thierry Lach does the freshmeat announcements
which require a login so just inform him.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="release_process_test_failed"></a>2.5.1. The release did not work</h3></div></div><a class="indexterm" name="d0e1481"></a><p>
This shouldn't happen! This really shouldn't happen!
</p><p>
The reason that this has happened is that one of the developers 
has made a misstake.
You now must decide a way forward.
</p><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="release_work_fix_problem_yourself"></a>2.5.1.1. Fix the problem yourself.</h4></div></div><p>
If the problem is obvious to you and you can fix it quickly, do so.
This is done by doing the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Make the release tag into a branch</p><p>
<b>cvs rtag -b -r VERSION_<i><tt>X_Y_Z</tt></i>_F BRANCH_<i><tt>X_Y_Z</tt></i></b>
</p></li><li><p>Update you checked out copy to be on that branch</p><p>
<b>cvs update -r BRANCH_<i><tt>X_Y_Z</tt></i></b>
</p></li><li><p>Fix the problem in your checked out copy</p></li><li><p>Commit the problem in the branch</p><p>
<b>cvs commit -m'Fix of problem blabla'</b>
</p></li><li><p>Continue the build process</p><p>
This is done by restarting the <b>build dist-release</b>-command
and from that point on working in the branch instead of at the tag.
</p></li><li><p>
Explain to the culprit what mistakes he has made and how to fix it.
</p><p>
It is now his responsibility to make sure that the problem will not
appear in the next version.
He can do this either by merging in your fix or by fixing the problem
in some other way.
</p><p>
At this point an in-detail description of how poor programming skills
the culprit has and how ugly his mother is, is probably in place but
please keep it constructive!
Remember, you might be misstaken when you guess who the responsible is.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e1546"></a>2.5.1.2. 
Delay the release waiting for someone to fix the problem.
</h4></div></div><p>
Create the branch as described in 
<a href="ch02s05.html#release_work_fix_problem_yourself" title="2.5.1.1. Fix the problem yourself.">Section 2.5.1.1</a>.
Then tell the culprit and everyone on the developer list
what the problem is and that it is to be fixed in the
release branch a.s.a.p.
</p><p>
Monitor the changes made to the branch to verify that
noone commits anything else but the solutions to the
problems.
</p><p>
When you get notified that it is completed, 
update your checked out copy and continue the release work.
