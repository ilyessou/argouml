This chapter contains written down ideas on what goes into what
part of the documentation. These ideas are formulated by Linus Tolke.
</p></div></div></div><p>
There are seven significantly different bits of documentation in the 
ArgoUML project.
By documentation I mean some information of the product that is 
developed alongside the product and that has a persistant value.
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>The code, variablenames, class names</p></li><li><p>The javadoc</p></li><li><p>The cookbook</p></li><li><p>The web site in CVS</p></li><li><p>The manual and quick-guide</p></li><li><p>Help texts within the running ArgoUML</p></li><li><p>The FAQ</p></li></ol></div><p>
These different bits have all different purpose and audience and 
the purpose of this chapter is to try to define that.

Be a collection of knowledge around how and why the project makes
certain decisions.
</td><td>

Instructions on how to do the chores around maintenance 
(build a release, publish a release,
