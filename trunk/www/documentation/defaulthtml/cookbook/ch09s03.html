In the ArgoUML project we use several sub-products to solve parts
of the problem for us.
These sub-products are an important part of the ArgoUML tool and
must be handled in a good way if ArgoUML is going to be successful.
</p><p>
When this is written (March 2004) we have had problems with the
discontinuance of one of the sub-products (NSUML) and will continue to 
have it for well some time in the future, until we have managed to replace it.
The problem with NSUML could probably not have been foreseen or avoided
if this checklist would have been in place when NSUML was taken into
the project but some more apparent risks with sub-product candidates might be.
</p><p>
Here is the list of things to check in the sub-product
and to discuss with yourself and maybe with the ArgoUML development team
before considering to use it in the ArgoUML project.
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
License
</p><p>
We must be allowed to
develop against,
release with,
distribute, and
use
the sub-product indefinitely
without monetary or other compensation.
</p><p>
Rationale: 
We have no money in the ArgoUML project,
we don't want to have money in the ArgoUML project.
We have no organization that can enter agreements and live up to them.
We don't want to require our users to enter agreements to use ArgoUML.
</p></li><li><p>
Java version
</p><p>
The sub-product must have a policy that matches the ArgoUML project policy
on Java version requirements.
</p><p>
Rationale: 
The ambition for ArgoUML is to be a working tool for
as many people as possible.
Java is still under development and there are nice features available in
future releases.
In ArgoUML we have a plan for how to handle this. It is to always support
two major releases of Java (currently JDK 1.3 and 1.4).
We cannot have a sub-product that restricts us in this aspect.
</p></li><li><p>
Distribution
</p><p>
We require the sub-products to make it possible for us to take the distribution,
enter it in our CVS repository and write rules to automate
the use of the sub-product while developing, releasing and running ArgoUML.
This automated use must be able to run without relying on access to some
server and without user intervention.
</p><p>
The API documentation of the sub-product (assumed to be Javadoc)
we can use from some web site belonging to that sub-product.
</p><p>
Rationale: 
In the ArgoUML project we want to make it as easy as possible for our users
to install ArgoUML.
We also want to make it as easy as possible for our developers to get their
development environment working and for the release manager to prepare
the releases.
</p></li><li><p>
Road map
</p><p>
The project developing the sub-product must have a plan that fits
the ArgoUML plan for the future.
</p><p>
Rationale: 
If a sub-product will soon go somewhere else
i.e. stop doing what we require or stop supporting what we require,
then we will soon have troubles with that sub-product.
</p></li><li><p>
Working project
</p><p>
The project that develops the sub-product should be a working project.
Check that there is some person responsible for it,
preferably with a team or organization backing him.
Check that there is a plan for upcoming releases.
Check that there is a way to report bugs and enhancement requests.
</p><p>
Rationale:
We don't want to rely on a sub-product where there is no chance of ever
getting a bug that we encounter fixed.
We are also part of an ever-evolving world.
Soon we want the tool to do more for us.
We should then be able to wish that and eventually get an updated sub-product.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Notice that we should not and don't need to do this in a passive way.
We should explain to the sub-product team what we want and why.
Especially for sub-products that we have already in ArgoUML but also
for project that we consider taking in.
This is to increase the likelihood that they will have us in mind when
planning and evolving.
</p><p>
Here are the steps to go through and the recommended order
once the decision is taken to use the sub-product in ArgoUML:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Documentation
</p><p>
Describe in the Cookbook in the appropriate subsystem section
what part of the problem that the sub-product solves and
how it is used in ArgoUML.
</p></li><li><p>
Javadoc
</p><p>
Enter the package list file in a special directory under
<tt class="filename">argouml/lib/javadocs</tt>.
Update the list of links used when building the Javadocs.
One place in <tt class="filename">default.properties</tt>,
One or two places in <tt class="filename">build.xml</tt>
(targets javadocs and javadocs-api).
</p><p>
Test by referencing some class from the sub-product,
building the Javadoc, and
check that the link is working.
</p></li><li><p>
Repository
</p><p>
Assuming that the sub-product is distributed in a set of jar files,
add the jar files to the <tt class="filename">lib</tt> directory
in a versioned way together with the license file.
Use filenames like:
<tt class="filename"><i class="replaceable"><tt>subproduct</tt></i>-<i class="replaceable"><tt>version</tt></i>.jar</tt>, and
<tt class="filename"><i class="replaceable"><tt>subproduct</tt></i>.LICENSE.txt</tt>.
</p><p>
A future plan is to have each subsystem in their own directory.
If the sub-product in question belongs to a subsystem that is moved to a
separate directory you should put it in
the <tt class="filename">lib</tt> directory for that subsystem.
For the time being, there is only one
<tt class="filename">lib</tt> directory.
</p></li><li><p>
Building
</p><p>
Assuming that the sub-product is distributed in a set of jar files,
add the jar files to the list of files that are to be included
when building ArgoUML.
One place in <tt class="filename">default.properties</tt>,
Four places in <tt class="filename">build.xml</tt>
(targets init (tree places),
prerequisites,
package (two places),
new target check.<i class="replaceable"><tt>subproduct</tt></i>), and
One possibly place in <tt class="filename">AboutBox.java</tt> (Constructor).
Notice especially that <tt class="filename">build.xml</tt> shall not contain
any version information.
Notice also that the text in <tt class="filename">AboutBox.java</tt>
shall not contain anything that needs to be localized but just
the sub-product name, reference and possibly version.
</p><p>
Check by having some class from the sub-product loaded immediately
when starting ArgoUML and start using
<span><b class="command">build run</b></span>.
</p></li><li><p>
Running from modules
</p><p>
With the current modules set up
(in <tt class="filename">argouml/modules</tt>) the
idea is that we are supposed to be able to start ArgoUML from any
of the modules directory.
This means that whenever changing the list of modules you will have
to update the classpaths in all these modules.
Go through the list of files <tt class="filename">argouml/modules/*/build.xml</tt>
and update.
</p><p>
Check by having some class from the sub-product loaded immediately
when starting ArgoUML and start in each of these directories.
</p></li><li><p>
Distribution
</p><p>
Assuming that the sub-product is distributed in a set of jar files,
add the jar files to the list of files that are to be included
when releasing ArgoUML.
One place in <tt class="filename">build.xml</tt> (target dist-javawebstart),
One place in <tt class="filename">manifest.template</tt> (Class-Path),
In each of the Java Web Start files (resources),
In the <tt class="filename">Info.plist</tt> (ClassPath).
</p><p>
Check by having some class from the sub-product loaded immediately
when starting ArgoUML and start with
<span><b class="command">java -jar argouml.jar</b></span>,
using each of the Java Web Start files, and
from the Appbund (on a Mac).
