        (<span class="guiicon"><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/icons/nav_config.gif" align="middle"></span></span>) at the top left of the 
        explorer brings up the explorer perspectives dialog (see
        <a href="ch10s05.html#fig.ref.navigator_pane_perspectives" title="Figure&nbsp;10.2.&nbsp;The Configure Perspectives dialog box">Figure&nbsp;10.2, &#8220;The Configure Perspectives dialog box&#8221;</a>).</p><div class="figure-float"><div class="figure"><a name="fig.ref.navigator_pane_perspectives"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;10.2.&nbsp;The Configure Perspectives dialog box</b></p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/reference/navigator_pane_perspectives.png" align="middle" alt="The Configure Perspectives dialog box"></div></div><p></p></div></div><p>The top half of the dialog contains a list of all
        the currently defined perspectives and to the right a series of buttons
        stacked vertically. 
        Button&nbsp;1 click can be used to select a perspective. 
        You can select only one perspective at a time.
      </p><p>
	    Selecting a perspective reveals a text field above the list, 
	    where the name of the perspective can be edited.
	  </p><p>The lower half of the dialog contains two list areas. The one on
        the left, labeled <tt class="literal">Rules&nbsp;Library</tt>, contains
        the list of available rules that may be used to create the
        perspective. The one on the right,
        labeled <tt class="literal">Selected&nbsp;Rules</tt>
        contains the actual rules chosen for the perspective 
        that has been selected in the list of perspectives at the top.
        In both lists, you can select only one rule at a time.
      </p><p>Separating the two areas in the lower half of the dialog
        are buttons labeled
        <tt class="literal">&gt;&gt;</tt> and <tt class="literal">&lt;&lt;</tt>. The first
        of these transfers the rule selected in the library on the left 
        to the list of rules on the
        right&#8212;i.e. it adds a rule to the perspective. 
        The second one transfers
        the rule selected on the right to the library list 
        on the left&#8212;i.e. it
        removes a rule from the perspective.
      </p><p>
	    If you hover the mouse over the horizontal line that seperates the 
	    two halves of the dialog, then you see it change shape, 
	    to indicate that you can grab
	    this line and drag it up or down. 
	  </p><p>
	    All three titles of the lists do show the numer of items in the list. 
	    ArgoUML V0.18 has 8 default perspectives, 
	    and 60 rules in the library to build perspectives from. 
	  </p><p>
	    The buttons at the top right are explained as follows: 
	  </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><tt class="literal">New</tt>. This creates a new perspective
          from scratch with no rules selected, 
          with an automatically generated name.</p></li><li><p><tt class="literal">Remove</tt>. This removes the selected
          perspective.</p></li><li><p><tt class="literal">Duplicate</tt>. This creates a copy the
          selected perspective so it can be used as the basis of a new
          perspective. 
          The new one is named "Copy of" followed by the original name.</p></li><li><p><tt class="literal">Move Up</tt>. This moves the
          selected perspective one place up in the list. 
          This button is downlighted for the topmost perspective.</p></li><li><p><tt class="literal">Move Down</tt>. This moves the
          selected perspective one place down in the list.
          This button is downlighted for the last perspective.</p></li><li><p><tt class="literal">Restore Defaults</tt>. This restores
          all perspectives and their selected rules
          to the build-in defaults of ArgoUML.</p></li></ul></div><p>At the very bottom right is a button labeled <tt class="literal">OK</tt>
        to be used when all changes are complete. button&nbsp;1 click on this
        button will close the dialog window. The changes are saved when you 
        exit ArgoUML 
        (or inmediately by activating the menuitem File-&gt;Save Configuration)
        in the <tt class="literal">argo.user.properties</tt> file.</p><p>Then there is the <tt class="literal">Cancel</tt> button, which
        cancels all changes made in the dialog. 
        Pressing the dialog close icon (usually at the top right corner) 
        has the same effect as pressing the cancel button.

        views simultaneously, with up to three panels of hierarchy. A dialog
        offers control of these panels, with an option to show or not show each
        panel, and the option of the second and third panels to be rooted at
        the selection on the previous panel, or to show the previously used
        hierarchy.</p><div class="caution" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Caution"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Caution]" src="images/caution.png"></td><th align="left">Caution</th></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top"><p>This functionality is not yet implemented in
        ArgoUML. The dialog is never shown.</p></td></tr></table></div><p>When using the explorer, it is worth bearing in mind that
        this is a useful visualization of the model, it is not
        <span class="emphasis"><em>solely</em></span> for navigation and selection.  It is also
        useful for users to easily (meaning a few mouse clicks without having
        to arrange a diagram) visualize the model structured according to some
        perspective.  For example, show me the state nesting, or show me the
        class inheritance tree, or show me the package nesting, or show me the
        list of actors.</p><p>The idea with the second and third explorer tree panes, is that
        sometimes it is easier to explore the tree to a certain level in one
        tree and then continue expanding in a second tree.  Since
        each tree will not be so deep, it will look more like a list.</p><p>For example, look at the way javadocs are viewed with frames: the
        packages are selected from one list, and interfaces, classes, and
        exceptions in that package are shown in a second pane.  In the case of
        javadocs, the second pane has a tree with three roots that are always
        expanded, but it is visually presented as three lists with three
        headers.</p><p>The other suggested use of a second or third nav panel is to list
        recently visited model elements.  This is simliar to the recently
        visited files listed on the <tt class="literal">File</tt> menu of most
        applications, but for model elements rather than files.</p><p>The motivtion is the fact that designers frequently
        &#8220;<span class="quote">interrupt</span>&#8221; themselves: they are thinking of working on
        one part of the design, and then they make a decision that needs a
        change in some other part, and then that has an implication on some
        other part, and&#8230; and&#8230; and&#8230; the designer forgets
        what it was they were originally trying to accomplish.  They need to
        &#8220;<span class="quote">pop their mental stack</span>&#8221; to come back to finish what the
        started.  If they fail to do that, they leave half-finished fragments
        all over the design which always seem to come out as soon as it is
        presented to someone else.</p><p>A recently visited list should be LIFO (stack) ordered, or FIFO
        (queue) ordered.  The goal would be to help designers come back to
        finish what they were doing, or simply to help them switch between two
        or three related parts of the design.  The <tt class="literal">Navigate
        Back</tt> and <tt class="literal">Navigate Forward</tt> buttons in the
        toolbar serve the same basic purpose and use a lot less screen
        space.</p><p>Tear-off tabs would also
        help with alternating between views, 
        but sometimes users don't want to work with so many separate windows.
        </p><p>This is the theory that motivates the idea of multiple nav
        panes. For more information see Jason Robbins' PhD dissertation <a href="http://argouml.tigris.org/docs/robbins_dissertation/" target="_top">
        http://argouml.tigris.org/docs/robbins_dissertation/</a>.  One
        practical usability concern is available screen space and another is
        visual complexity. For this reason the multiple panes have yet to be
        implemented in ArgoUML while more pressing issues are
        addressed.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch10s04.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch10.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch10s06.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">10.4.&nbsp;Perspective Selection&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;10.6.&nbsp;Context Sensitive Menu</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
