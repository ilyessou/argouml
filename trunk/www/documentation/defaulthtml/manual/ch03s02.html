We start with a top-level view of the problem we are solving and the
      key areas of functionality that we must address in any
      solution. This is our <span class="emphasis"><em>vision document</em></span>, and should
      be just a few pages long.</p><p>
For example the top-level view of an automated teller machine (ATM)
      might be that it should support the following.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Cash deposit, cash withdrawal and account inquiries by
        customers.</p></li><li><p>Maintenance of the equipment by the bank's engineers, and
        unloading of deposits and loading of cash by the local bank
        branch.</p></li><li><p>Audit trail for all activities sent to the bank's central
        computer.</p></li></ol></div><a class="indexterm" name="d0e2130"></a><p>
From this top-level view we can extract the principle activities of
      the system, and the external agents (people, equipment) that are involved
      in those activities. These activities are known as <span class="emphasis"><em>use
      cases</em></span> and the external agents are known as
      <span class="emphasis"><em>actors</em></span>.</p><p>Actors may be people or machines. From a practical standpoint it is
      worth knowing the stakeholder behind any machine, since only they will be
      able to engage with the requirements capture process.</p><a class="indexterm" name="d0e2143"></a><p>Use cases should be significant activities for the system. For
      example customer use of the ATM machine is a use case. Entering a PIN
      number is not.</p><p>There is a gray area between these two extremes. As we shall see it
      is often useful to break very large use cases into smaller sub-use
      cases. For example we may have sub-use cases covering cash deposit, cash
      withdrawal and account inquiry.</p><p>There is no hard and fast rule. Some architects will prefer a small
      number of relatively large use cases, others will prefer a larger number
      of smaller use cases. A useful rule of thumb is that any practical
      project ought to require no more than about 30 use cases (if it needs
      more, it should be broken into separate projects).</p><p>We then show the relationship between use cases and actors on one or
      more use case diagrams. For a large project more than one diagram will be
      needed. Usually groups of related use cases are shown on one
      diagram.</p><p>We must then give a more detailed specification of each use
      case. This covers its normal behavior, alternative behaviors and any pre-
      and post-conditions. This is captured in a document variously known as a
      <span class="emphasis"><em>use case specification</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>use case
      scenario</em></span>.</p><a class="indexterm" name="d0e2162"></a><p>Finally, since use cases are functional in nature, we need a document
      to capture the non-functional requirements (capacity, performance,
      environmental needs etc). These requirements are captured in a document
      known as a <span class="emphasis"><em>supplementary requirements
      specification</em></span>.</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e2170"></a>3.2.1.&nbsp;Process Steps</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>The steps in the requirements capture process can be summarized as
        follows.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><a class="indexterm" name="d0e2177"></a><p>Capture an overall view of the problem, and the desired
          characteristics of its solution in the <span class="emphasis"><em>vision
          document</em></span>.</p></li><li><a class="indexterm" name="d0e2186"></a><p>Identify the <span class="emphasis"><em>use case</em></span> and
          <span class="emphasis"><em>actors</em></span> from the vision document and show their
          relationships on one or more <span class="emphasis"><em>use case
          diagrams</em></span>.</p></li><li><a class="indexterm" name="d0e2201"></a><a class="indexterm" name="d0e2206"></a><p>Give detailed <span class="emphasis"><em>use case
          specifications</em></span> for each use case, covering normal and
          alternate behavior, pre- and post-conditions.</p></li><li><a class="indexterm" name="d0e2217"></a><a class="indexterm" name="d0e2220"></a><p>Capture all non-functional requirements in a
          <span class="emphasis"><em>supplementary requirements
          specification</em></span>.</p></li></ol></div><p>In any iterative development process, there will be an exercise of
        prioritization, and early iterations will focus on capturing the key
        behavior of the most important use cases.</p><p>Most modern requirements capture processes agree that it is
        essential that the authoritative representative of the customer is
        fully involved throughout the process.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch03.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch03.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch03s03.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Requirements Capture&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;3.3.&nbsp;Output of the Requirements Capture Process</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
