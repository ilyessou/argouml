        navigation hierarchy is organized by package hierarchy. The top level
        shows the model. Under this are all the top level packages in the model
        and all the artifacts that are directly in the namespace of the
        model.</p><p>Beneath each package are all the artifacts that sit within the
        namespace of that package, including any further sub-packages (which in
        turn have their own sub-hierarchies).</p></li><li><p><a name="N24b6"></a><tt>Diagram-centric</tt>. In this view the top
        level comprises all the diagrams in the model. Beneath each diagram is
        a flat listing of all the artifacts on the diagram. Artifacts that have
        sub-artifacts that do not appear on the diagram have their own
        hierarchy (for example attributes and operations of
        classes).</p></li><li><p><a name="N24be"></a><tt>Inheritance-centric</tt>. In this view the
        top level shows the model. Beneath this are all artifacts that have no
        generalization in the model. Those artifacts that have specializations
        have a sub-hierarchy showing the specializations.</p></li><li><p><a name="N24c6"></a><tt>Class Associations</tt>. In this view the
        top level shows the model. Beneath this are all diagrams and all
        classes. All classes that have associations have a hierarchy tracking
        through the associated classes.</p></li><li><p><a name="N24ce"></a><tt>Navigable Associations</tt>. This is
        identical to the Class Associations ordering, but includes only
        navigable associations.</p></li><li><p><a name="N24d6"></a><tt>Association-centric</tt>. In this view the
        top level shows the model. Beneath this are all diagrams and all
        associations. All associations have then have a sub-hierarchy listing
        the classes they connect. Where classes have associated state diagrams
        these are shown beneath the class.</p></li><li><p><a name="N24de"></a><tt>State-centric</tt>. In this view the top
        level shows all the state machines and all activity graphics associated
        with classes. The state machine for <i>Class</i> is named
        <i>Class</i><tt>StateMachine</tt> and the
        activity graph for <i>Class</i> is named
        <i>Class</i><tt>ActivityGraph</tt>.</p><p>Beneath each state machine is a hierarchy showing the state
        diagram and all of the states. Beneath each state is a list of the
        transitions in and out of the state.</p><p>Beneath each activity graph is a hierarchy showing the activity
        diagram and all of the action states. Beneath each action state is a
        list of the transitions in and out of the action
        state.</p></li><li><p><a name="N2500"></a><tt>Transitions-centric</tt>. This is very
        similar to <tt>State-centric</tt> view, but under each state
        machine is listed the diagrams and all transitions on the diagram, with
        states being shown as sub-hierarchies under their connected
        transitions.</p><p>Similarly under each activity graph is listed the diagrams and all
        transitions on the diagram, with action states being shown as
        sub-hierarchies under their connected transitions.</p></li><li><p><a name="N2510"></a><tt>Transitions-paths</tt>. This is again
        similar to <tt>State-centric</tt> view. However under each
        state machine is shown the state diagram and the initial state. Under
        the initial state is a hierarchy showing the states to which it has
        transitions, and so on for each of those states. A similar structure is
        used for activity diagrams.</p></li><li><p><a name="N251d"></a><tt>Collaboration-centric</tt>. This should
        show all collaborations in the view with artifacts in hierarchies under
        their collaborations.</p><div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0"><tr><td align="center" rowspan="2" valign="top" width="25"><img src="images/warning.png"></td><th><a name="N2525"></a>Warning</th></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2" valign="top"><p>In the current release of ArgoUML this view is broken,
