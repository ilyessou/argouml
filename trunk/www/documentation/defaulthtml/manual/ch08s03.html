        exploring hierarchy is organized by package hierarchy. The top level

        and all the artifacts that are directly in the namespace of the

        namespace of that package, including any further sub-packages (which in
        turn have their own sub-hierarchies).</p></li><li><p><tt class="literal">Diagram-centric</tt>. In this view the top
        level comprises all the diagrams in the model. Beneath each diagram is
        a flat listing of all the artifacts on the diagram. Artifacts that have
        sub-artifacts that do not appear on the diagram have their own
        hierarchy (for example attributes and operations of
        classes).</p></li><li><p><tt class="literal">Inheritance-centric</tt>. In this view the
        top level shows the model. Beneath this are all artifacts that have no
        generalization in the model. Those artifacts that have specializations
        have a sub-hierarchy showing the specializations.</p></li><li><p><tt class="literal">Class Associations</tt>. In this view the
        top level shows the model. Beneath this are all diagrams and all
        classes. All classes that have associations have a hierarchy tracking
        through the associated classes.</p></li><li><p><tt class="literal">Navigable Associations</tt>. This is
        identical to the Class Associations ordering, but includes only
        navigable associations.</p></li><li><p><tt class="literal">Association-centric</tt>. In this view the
        top level shows the model. Beneath this are all diagrams and all
        associations. All associations then have a sub-hierarchy listing
        the classes they connect. Where classes have associated state diagrams
        these are shown beneath the class.</p></li><li><p><tt class="literal">State-centric</tt>. In this view the top
        level shows all the state machines and all activity graphics associated
        with classes. The state machine for <span class="emphasis"><em>Class</em></span> is named
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Class</em></span><tt class="literal">StateMachine</tt> and the

        similar to <tt class="literal">State-centric</tt> view, but under each state
        machine is listed the diagrams and all transitions on the diagram, with
        states being shown as sub-hierarchies under their connected
        transitions.</p><p>Similarly under each activity graph is listed the diagrams and all
        transitions on the diagram, with action states being shown as

        similar to <tt class="literal">State-centric</tt> view. However under each
        state machine is shown the state diagram and the initial state. Under
        the initial state is a hierarchy showing the states to which it has
        transitions, and so on for each of those states. A similar structure is
        used for activity diagrams.</p></li><li><p><tt class="literal">Collaboration-centric</tt>. This should
        show all collaborations in the view with artifacts in hierarchies under
        their collaborations.</p><div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Warning"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Warning]" src="images/warning.png"></td><th align="left">Warning</th></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top"><p>In the current release of ArgoUML this view is broken,
