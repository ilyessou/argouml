Mouse Behavior in the Editing Pane</h2></div></div><p>Behaviour of the mouse in general, and the naming of the buttons is
      covered in the chapter on the overall user interface (see
      <a href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. User Interface Reference">Chapter 7</a>).</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e4173"></a>9.2.1. Button&nbsp;1 Click</h3></div></div><p>In the tool bar of the editing pane, button&nbsp;1 click is used to
        select the next tool for adding artifacts to the diagram (but only
        once&#8212;see double clicking for adding multiple artifacts).  Adding
        to the diagram is achieved by moving the mouse to the editing area and
        clicking again.</p><p>In the main editing area button&nbsp;1 click is used to select an
        individual artifact.</p><p>Where button&nbsp;2 click has been used to bring up a context sensitive
        pop-up menu (see below), button&nbsp;1 click is used to select the menu
        entry required. button&nbsp;1 click outside the menu area will remove
        it.</p><p>There are various more detailed effects, which are discussed under
        the descriptions of the various tools (see <a href="ch09s03.html" title="9.3. The tool bar">Section 9.3</a>).</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="s2.ref.edit_button1_double_click"></a>9.2.2. Button&nbsp;1 Double Click</h3></div></div><p>When used on the tool bar with a tool to add an artifact, the
        selected artifact will be added multiple times to the drawing area,
        once for each further button click, until the tool is again selected or
        another tool chosen.</p><p>When used within the drawing area on an artifact that has
        sub-components, double click will select the sub-component (creating
        it if necessary).</p><p>For example double clicking over an operation compartment of a
        class will select the operation. Or create one if there is not one
        there.</p><p>A special use is with package artifacts on the class diagram. A
        double click on a package will take you to the class diagram associated
        with a package (the first created if there is more than one), or will
        offer to create one for you if there is none.</p><p>You can &#8220;spawn&#8221; a copy of the editing pane by
        double-clicking on the <tt>As Diagram</tt> tab at the bottom
        of the pane. It will then show as an individual window and you can put
        it where you will on the screen.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e4207"></a>9.2.3. Button&nbsp;1 Motion</h3></div></div><p>When adding an artifact using the toolbar, button&nbsp;1 motion can
        generally be used to define the size of the new artifact. Its
        dimensions (line ends, diagonal corners of a rectangular artifact etc)
        are defined by button&nbsp;1 down and button&nbsp;1 up.</p><p>Where the artifact being added is some form of connector its
        termination point is shown with button&nbsp;1 up over the terminating
        artifact. button&nbsp;1 click may be used in the space between artifacts to
        create articulation points in the connector. This is particularly
        useful where connectors must loopback on themselves.</p><p>Over graphical artifacts button&nbsp;1 motion will move the artifact to
        a new position. Graphical artifacts that are selected show handles, and
        these can be used for re-sizing.</p><p>Some artifacts (e.g. actor, class) show special handles at the
        sides, top and bottom, which can be dragged to form types of
        relationship with other artifacts.</p><p>Where the artifact is some form of connector between other items,
        button&nbsp;1 motion other than at a handle will cause a new handle to be
        created, allowing the connector to be articulated at that point. Such
        new handles can be removed by moving them to the end of the
        connector.</p><p>There are various more detailed effects, which are discussed under
        the descriptions of the various tools (see <a href="ch09s03.html" title="9.3. The tool bar">Section 9.3</a>).</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e4225"></a>9.2.4. Shift and Control with Button&nbsp;1</h3></div></div><p>Where selections are to be made, the SHIFT key is used to with
        button&nbsp;1 to <span class="emphasis"><i>add</i></span> unselected artifacts to the
        current selection. Where an artifact is already selected, it is removed
        from the current selection.</p><p>Using the CONTROL key invokes the broom tool, causing the selected
        artifacts (and any others swept up with them) to be moved with the
        broom tool (see <a href="ch09s03.html#s2.ref.edit_layout" title="9.3.1.

Button&nbsp;2 Actions</h3></div></div><p>When used over artifacts in the the editing pane, this will display
        a context dependent pop-up menu. Menu entries are highlighted (but not
        selected) and sub-menus exposed by subsequent mouse motion (without any
        buttons). Menu entry selection is with button&nbsp;1</p><p>If the artifact generating the menu has not yet been selected it
        will also be selected.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e4246"></a>9.2.6. Button&nbsp;2 Double Click</h3></div></div><p>This has no effect other than that of button&nbsp;2 single
