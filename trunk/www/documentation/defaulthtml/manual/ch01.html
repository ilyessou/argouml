Origins and Overview of ArgoUML</h2></div></div><div class="sect2"><a name="s2.ooad"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="s2.ooad"></a>1.1.1. Object Oriented Analysis and Design</h3></div></div><p>Over the past decade, Object Oriented Analysis and Design (OOA&amp;D)
        has become <i>the</i> dominant software development
        paradigm. With it has come a major shift in the thought processes of
        all involved in the software development life cycle.</p><p>Programming language support for objects began with Simula&nbsp;67,
        but it was the emergence in the 1980's of hybrid languages, such as
        C++, Ada and Object Pascal that allowed OOA&amp;D to take off. These
        languages provided support for both OO and procedural
        programming. Object Oriented <i>programming</i> became
        mainstream.</p><p>An OO system is designed and implemented as a
        <i>simulation</i> of the real world using software
        artifacts. This premise is as powerful as it is simple. By using an OO
        approach to <i>design</i> a system can be designed and
        tested (or more correctly simulated) without having to actually build
        the system first.</p><p>It is the development during the 1990's of tools to support Object
        Oriented <i>analysis</i> and <i>design</i>
        that moved this approach into the mainstream. When coupled with the
        ability to design systems at a very high level, a tool based OOA&amp;D
        approach has enabled the implementation of more complex than previously
        possible.</p><p>The final driver that has propelled OOA&amp;D has been its suitability
        for modeling graphical user interfaces. The popularity of object based
        and object oriented graphical languages such as Visual Basic and Java
        reflect the effectiveness of this approach.</p></div><div class="sect2"><a name="Nbd9"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="Nbd9"></a>1.1.2. The Development of ArgoUML</h3></div></div><p>During the 1980's a number of OOA&amp;D process methodologies and
        notations were developed by different research teams. It became clear
        that were many common themes, and during the 1990's a unified approach
        for OOA&amp;D notation was developed under the auspices of the
        <a href="http://www.omg.org" target="_top">Object Management Group</a>. This
        standard became known as the Unified Modeling Language (UML), and is
        now the standard language for communicating OO concepts.</p><p>ArgoUML was conceived as a tool and environment for use in the
        analysis and design of object-oriented software systems. In this sense
        it is similar to many of the commercial CASE tools that are sold as
        tools for modeling software systems. ArgoUML has a number of very
        important distinctions from many of these tools.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p><a name="Nbef"></a>ArgoUML draws on research in cognitive psychology to
          provide novel features that increase productivity by supporting the
          cognitive needs object-oriented software designers and
          architects.</p></li><li><p><a name="Nbf3"></a>ArgoUML supports open standards
          extensively&#8212;UML, XMI, SVG, OCL and others. In this respect,
          ArgoUML is still ahead of many commercial tools.</p></li><li><p><a name="Nbf7"></a>ArgoUML is a 100% pure Java application. This allows
          ArgoUML to run on all platforms for which a reliable port of the
          Java2 platform is available.</p></li><li><p><a name="Nbfb"></a>ArgoUML is an open source project. The availability
          of the source permits ensures that a new generation of software
          designers and researchers now have a proven framework from which they
          can drive the development and evolution of CASE tool
          technologies.</p></li></ol></div><p>In creating the ArgoUML development tool and environment, Jason
        Robbins and the rest of his research team at the University of
        California, Irvine leveraged the benefits of UML as the most prevalent
        OO modeling language and Java as one of the most productive OO
        development platforms to produce a solid tool for OO systems design
        and, further a test bed for the evolution of object oriented CASE tools
        development and research.</p><p>A first release of ArgoUML was available in 1998 and more than
        100,000 downloads since then show the impact that this project has
        made, being popular in educational and commercial fields.</p></div><div class="sect2"><a name="Nc09"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="Nc09"></a>1.1.3.

The ArgoUML Development Process and the Infrastructure it
        Uses</h4></div></div><p>Although Jason Elliot Robbins (he's still actively involved,
          being the maintainer of the Tigris host at CollabNet, where the
          project is hosted now) has stepped back from project leadership and
          handed the stab to Tobias Baier, the project is still going
          strong. There are more than 300 members on the developer mailing list
          (see <a href="http://argouml.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectMailingListList" target="_top">
            http://argouml.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectMailingListList</a>),
          with 15-20 forming the core group.</p><p>This is the place where all the discussion on the latest tasks
          takes place, and developers discuss the directions the project should
          take. Although controversial at times, these discussions are always
          kept nice and friendly (no flame-wars and such), so newbies should
          not hesitate and participate in them. They'll always get a warm
          welcome there.</p></div><div class="sect3"><a name="Nc23"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="Nc23"></a>1.1.3.2. More on Infrastructure</h4></div></div><p>Besides the developer mailing list, there's also a mailing for
          users (see <a href="http://argouml.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectMailingListList" target="_top">
            http://argouml.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectMailingListList</a>),
          where they can discuss problems from a user perspective. Some
          developers also read this list, so there's a good chance to get
          qualified help.</p><p>Before posting to this list, you should take a look at the
