ARGO has not locked up on me once!</p><p>The waters are choppy in places (nasty currents in the Save waters), unpredictable winds (Will it open old documents? Will I be able to reuse the software maps I've already created?).</p><p>The navigation charts are skimpy at best (We're on our way with DocBook XML but little more than an agreement on software for the moment!) but the crew is full of professionals! Together we'll get ARGO from the development port to the production port! </p><p>Understandably when you get into a boat you plan on going somewhere. But don't plan on a cross Atlantic trip with ARGO, it's more appropriate for a lake cruise in calm weather.</p><p>ARGO is NOT production ready! Meaning you will get distracted by the things you can't do and you'll feel like your drowning sometimes if you've used commercial UML tools. But, hey, ARGO started as an academic project, not a commercial project. And, it's free, the potential is there, that's clear, because you are here...</p><p>All open source projects are as useful and helpful as the users and developers identify and implement use cases, code, correct misunderstandings, identify bugs, and help with the documentation!</p><p>We need your help and here's how.</p><p>Use the Java Web Start (JWS)Version ! This will give you the latest "stable" build. Version .8.1 is officially supported by the developers, but give the JWS version a try! </p><p>Technically, the latest CVS of ARGO can Reverse Engineer compiling Java code...which means we will soon have all of the classes of ARGO in UML form! That'll help everyone to better understand and advance the code and, most importantly...usability!</p><p>Try to get into the habit of modeling your questions using UML! It'll help you learn the ins and outs of UML and it'll give the developers and the users a better idea of how to use ARGO, what does and does not work AND for budding developers a chance to model real code! </p><p>And then what you ask?</p><p>Save your diagrams as .zargo! And mail them to the user group as attachments! This will help all of us by building a library of UML diagrams for reference and for development purposes!</p><p></p><p>If you're comfortable coding, jump into the developer's galley and build ARGO from the inside out with the CVS. The CVS has functionalities that have not been deemed ready for JWS release yet. Give it a try! You'll find some tips on using the CVS in this user document.</p><p></p><p>We'll help you along the way too! Please specify your ARGO version and your OS when making your requests for help. </p><p></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table summary="Navigation footer" width="100%"><tr><td align="left" width="40%"><a href="index.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td align="center" width="20%"><a href="index.html">Home</a></td><td align="right" width="40%">&nbsp;<a href="ch02.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td align="left" width="40%">ArgoUML and Poseidon for UML&nbsp;</td><td align="center" width="20%"><a href="index.html">Up</a></td><td align="right" width="40%">&nbsp;Chapter 2.
