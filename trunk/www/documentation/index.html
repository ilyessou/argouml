<h1>Documentation Resources</h1>
<p>
Currently the following resources have been made available:
<h2>User Documentation</h2>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="defaulthtml/quick-guide/">Quick Guide</a>
on how to get started.
<li>The <a href="defaulthtml/manual/">User Manual</a>
    (<a href="defaulthtml/manual/">[HTML]</a> | 
    <a href="pdf/manual/argomanual.pdf">[pdf]</a>).
<li>A <a href="/tours/">tour</a> through ArgoUML.
    This tour gives you a nice impression of the concepts of ArgoUML and what it can do.
Note. The tour might contain some small differences from the current version of ArgoUML.
<li><a href="defaulthtml/faq/">Frequently asked questions (FAQ)</a>
</ul>
<h2>Other things of interest</h2>
<ul> 
<li><a href="umlsupport/">List UML-features not yet supported by ArgoUML</a>
<li>Other UML resources
   <ul>
     <li> <a href="http://www.omg.org/uml/">OMG UML Page</a>
     <li> <a href="/servlets/ProjectDocumentList">List of webpages, book, companies on UML</a>
   </ul>
<li> <a href="/project.html">Contribute</a> to the ArgoUML project
</ul>
<p>
The User Manual and Quick Guide are the ones provided with the
0.9.6 release of ArgoUML.
This is also the first release of the Quick Guide and User Manual and
the User Manual is not complete.
It is however already very helpful in a lot of areas.
<p>
The work with these documents continues.
We are still looking for volunteers to help completing and improving 
these manuals.
Not-yet-released versions are available for the purpose of proof-reading
and discussion among the authors and contributers.
You can look at them if you are interested to take part 
or monitor the progress.
The snap shots are:
<a href="snapshot/manual/argomanual.html">Manual</a>,
<a href="snapshot/quick-guide/quickguide.html">Quick guide</a>,
and
<a href="snapshot/faq/faq.html">FAQ</a>.
Voice your opinions about the direction and progress of these documents
on the developers' mailing list.
