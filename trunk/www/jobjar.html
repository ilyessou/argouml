<H2>JobJar: List of much needed contributions</H2>

<table>

<td valign="top" rowspan="7" width="50%">

<H3>Proposed Contributions</H3>

<H4>Diagrams</H4>

<UL>
	<LI>Implement a graph layout algorithm that takes into account the
	conventions of UML diagrams. 
 already a layout algorithm for class diagrams.
	<LI>Implement arc routing that users find flexible and convient.
	This could be contributed to the GEF project and used in ArgoUml.
	
	<LI>Implement the UML artifacts that ArgoUML still does not support.
	
	<LI>Implement diagram types that are part of UML but not supported
	by ArgoUML yet.

	<LI>Swim lanes for statechart and activity diagrams. 

	<LI>Implement printing of wall-sized diagram posters or design booklets.
te the generic code to the GEF project and use it in ArgoUml.
</UL>

<H4>Class Diagram</H4>
<UL>
        <li>Implement the 'lollipop' notation for Interfaces.
        <li>Improve Copy/ paste support.
</UL>

<H4>Code Generation and Reverse Engineering</H4>

<UL>
	<LI>Implement code generation for an additional
	    programming language like:
	    ADA.

        <LI>Implement support for generating Java code that follows JavaBeans
	conventions.

	<LI>Implement an extensible and customizable library for code generation
	in many languages.

	<LI>Implement code generation for UML state machine models, work on this has
been done in a Masters Thesis.

	<LI>Generate assert() statements to check OCL constraints on a UML
	model at run-time.

	<LI>Make the code generation work together with the
	    reverse engineering for working round-trip engineering.

	<LI>Review and improve the <a href="http://www.antlr.org/">ANTLR</a> <a
href="http://www.antlr.org/grammar/java">Java grammar</a>.

        <LI>Implement C++ reverse engineering, possibly using an <a
href="http://www.antlr.org/grammar/cpp/MyReadMe.txt">ANTLR
C++ grammar</a>.

	<LI>Implement J2EE reverse engineering, can you reverse engineer
An Enterprise Application (.ear file)? Can you reverse engineer a deployment
diagram based on configuration files (Apache, App Server)?

</UL>

<H4>User Interface</H4>
<UL>
        <li>Document the requirements for ArgoUML in terms of use cases
and in the cookbook.
	<LI>Implement table views
	    (as a complement to the tree view and  diagram view).
	<LI>Implement Undo / redo.
	    Co-ordinate with this for diagrams (GEF project).
	<LI>Make ArgoUML work within Netbeans and Eclipse as a plugin.
</UL>

<H4>User Documentation</H4>
<UL>
	<LI>Write additions to the User's manual for ArgoUML, 
	focus on a specific task or audience.

	<LI>Write answers to the Users FAQ.
</UL>

<H4>Documentation and Instructions for the developers of ArgoUML</H4>
<UL>

      <LI>Write additions to the Developer's Cookbook to help new people contribute 
        to the ArgoUML project. 

      <LI>Write requirements / specification, e.g. how the yet unimplemented features 
        should work in detail.
</UL>

<H4>Object Constraint Language</H4>
<UL>
	<LI>Enhance ArgoUML's OCL evaluator.
	<LI>What features are needed in order to make writing and evaluating
constraints easier?
</UL>

<H4>Cognitive Support for Design</H4>
<UL>
	<LI>Improve on the existing Critics, Check lists, and To do items.
	<LI>Implement some more of the features suggested by Jason Robbins
	    in his dissertation.
	<LI>Design and implement completely new tools to do 
            Cognitive Support for Design.
</UL>

<H4>Quality assurance</H4>
<UL>
	<LI>Implement test scripts using JUnit.
	Focus on a specific class or group of classes.
</UL>

<H4>Performance</H4>
<UL>
	<LI>Measure what are the limits of ArgoUml's performance with large models.
	<LI>Use a Memory profiler, or Tracer to detect inefficient algorithms
	    and fix them.
</UL>

<H3>Assume a responsibility in the project</H3>

If you feel that you have time to assume a responsibility in
the ArgoUML project, contact the Project leader (Linus Tolke)
and discuss that.<p>

Responsibilities where we currently lack a person to assume them:
<ul>
<li>Users' FAQ editor.
<li>Web master for the Users' site.
</ul>

<H3>Special Note to Students</H3>

Each task could be made into an undergraduate term project or part of
a masters degree project. 
Working on a free, open source software project such as ArgoUML can
make your school project much more impressive, satisfying, and clarify
potential benefits.
<p>

<ul>
<li>Why start with nothing if you could build on the work of many students and
professionals?</li>
<li>Why end your term project with just a grade when you could make a
visible difference?</li>
</ul>

The point of a term project is to get experience working on a
&quot;real&quot; project. Using ArgoUML will give you experience with
over 200,000 lines of Java code that implements a real
application.
