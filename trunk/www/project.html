<H2>Argo/UML Project</H2>
<P>Argo/UML is being developed as part of the Ph.D. research of Jason Robbins. Argo/UML
is the latest tool in the Argo family of domain oriented design environments. This family of tools has been under
development for over three years. Other tools in the family support C2-style software architectures and requirements
engineering. All tools in the Argo family allow for construction of design artifacts and provide decision-support
features to help designers make better designs. Domain-indepentent features of the Argo infrastructure include:
critics, user models, the &quot;to do&quot; list metaphor, checklists, multiple perspectives.</FONT></P>

<P>In 1998 Argo/UML matured into a usable CASE tool with special features to help
designers with the cognitve challenges of object-oriented design. In Spring of 1999 we will continue to improve
the tool and conduct a series of user studies of the tools impact on the quality of designs and the productivity
of designers. As improvements are made, the latest version of Argo/UML will always be available from our website.</P>

<P>We are following the open-source software distribution model. We provide software
with source code free of charge, without promising support. Users are encouraged to report problems, contribute
fixes or other improvements, and suggest new features so that Argo/UML may evolve to better fit their needs.</P>

<P>We encourage you to download and try out Argo/UML. You will be seeing the future
of CASE tools in action. Argo/UML's Java implementation, strict meta-model conformance, and customization features
make it a very promising starting point for the development of in-house tools.</P>

<P>If you would like to contribute, subscribe to the developer list to discuss what you want to do. For ideas
