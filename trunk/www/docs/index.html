<b>Title:</b>
  On the Detection of Test Smells:
  A Metrics-Based Approach for General Fixture and Eager Test
<br>
<b>Author:</b> Bart Van Rompaey, Bart Du Bois, Serge Demeyer, Matthias Rieger
<br>
<b>Language:</b> English
<br>
<b>Published in:</b>
  IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering 33(12): 800-817 (2007)
<br>
<b>Abstract:</b>
<p>
As a fine-grained defect detection technique, unittesting
introduces a strong dependency on the structure of the
code. Accordingly, test co-evolution forms an additional burden
to the software developer, which can be tempered by writing tests
in a manner that makes them easier to change. Fortunately, we
are able to concretely express what a good test is by exploiting
the specific principles underlying unit testing. Analogous to the
concept of code smells, violations of these principles are termed
test smells. In this paper, we clarify the structural deficiencies
encapsulated in test smells by formalizing core test concepts
and their characteristics. To support the detection of two such
test smells, General Fixture and Eager Test, we propose a set
of metrics defined in terms of unit test concepts. We compare
their detection effectiveness using manual inspection and through
a comparison with human reviewing. While the latter is the
traditional means for test quality assurance, our results indicate
it not to be a reliable means for test smell detection. This work
thus stresses the need for a more reliable detection mechanism,
and provides an initial contribution through the validation of test
smell metrics.

<b>Title:</b> Characterizing the Relative Significance of a Test Smell
<br>
<b>Author:</b> Bart Van Rompaey, Bart Du Bois, and Serge Demeyer
<br>
<b>Language:</b> English
<br>
<b>Published in:</b>
In Proceedings of
the 22th IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance (ICSM 2006),
pp 391-400, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, September 25-27, 2006
<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>
<p>
Test code, just like any other code we write, erodes when frequently
changed. As such, refactoring, which has been shown to impact
maintainability and comprehensibility, can be part of a solution to
counter this erosion. We propose a metric-based heuristical approach,
which allows to rank occurrences of so-called test smells
(i.e. symptoms of poorly designed tests) according to their relative
significance. This ranking can subsequently be used to start
refactoring. Through an open-source case study, ArgoUML, we
demonstrate that we are able to identify those test cases who violate
unit test criteria.

<b>Abstract:</b>
<p>
The design is an important task in the object-oriented software development.
Collaborative tools has been considered to be used in software
development, however little effort has been made in 
the assessment of usage of these tools
for both productivity verification and effectiveness of collaborative
learning.
For the assessment of the effectiveness of collaborative learning, it is
required the data collection for analysis.
This article describes a study of data
collection for the assessment of the effectiveness of learning of
students groups where a collaborative tool was used
to assist the learning of UML.
</p>
<b>Resumo.</b>
<p>
O projeto é uma tarefa importante no desenvolvimento de software
orientado a objetos. Ferramentas colaborativas têm sido consideradas para
serem utilizadas no desenvolvimento de software, contudo pouco esforço tem
sido feito na avaliação do uso dessas ferramentas tanto para a verificação de
produtividade quanto para a eficácia do aprendizado colaborativo. Para
avaliação da eficácia do aprendizado colaborativo existe uma necessidade de
obtenção de dados para a análise. O presente artigo descreve um estudo da
coleta de dados para a avaliação da eficácia do aprendizado de grupos de
alunos onde uma ferramenta colaborativa foi empregada para auxiliar o
aprendizado da UML.

<b>Abstract:</b>
<p>
Noch vor der Erstellung eines detaillierten Entwurfs hilft ein
Spezifiationmodell eines komponenten-basierten Systems dabei, Probleme
so früh im Entwicklungsprozeß wie möglich zu entdecken. Die Sprache
CCL ('Component Constraint Language') wurde bei CIS entwickelt und
erlaubt den Entwickler 'Contextbased Constraints' dem
Spezifikationsmodell hinzuzufügen. Dadurch entsteht ein Modell, das
über die Beschreibung der statische Struktur des Systems
hinausgeht. Zur Zeit existiert allerdings kein Werkzeug, das das
Komponentenspezifikationsmodell in den Entwicklungsprozeß
integriert. Ziel dieser Diplomarbeit war der Entwurf eines solchen
Werkzeugs, um die Philosophie des Continuous Software Engineering
(CSE) zu unterstützten.
</p>

<b>Abstract translated to English:</b>
<p>
Before starting a detailed design, a specification model of the
component-based system assists the software developer in early problem
detection as soon as possible in the development process. The
Component Constraint Language (CCL) developed at CIS enables the
developer to add context-based constraints (CoCons) to a component
specification model. This produces a model which goes beyond the
simple description of the system's static structure. At this time,
there is no tool to integrate the component specification model into
the development process. The goal of this master's thesis was to
design such a tool, thereby supporting the Continuous Software
Engineering (CSE) philosophy.

<b>Abstract:</b>
<p>
Software quality remains a very subjective and at times vague,
notion. However it is a fact that most serious developers and the
majority of software users require some form of qualitative measure
for the software systems they are concerned with. Software quality
assurance can be carried out at various stages of the software
development process but this project deals with the measurement of the
quality of object-oriented designs. The implemented system will allow
the user to design any system using the Unified Modeling Language
(UML) and then provide quality readings from different perspectives of
the system. It is worth noting that it is virtually impossible to come
up with a quality scale to gauge the quality of systems. i.e. The
project will not produce a result such as "The system is considered
to be 85% good quality." This is mainly due to the fact that when
asking for a quality system, conflicts and contradictions tend to
occur (e.g. trying to develop a highly reusable system that is very
efficient). In the light of this fact, the system will not gauge the
quality of the system on a predefined scale but rather provide the
user metric readings that provide different views of the quality
characteristics of the system in question. The user will use the tool
to identify potential problem areas and fix them before the project
goes into implementation stage.

<b>Abstract:</b>
<p>
A prototype system that takes OCL expression strings as input and
interpret/evaluate them in the context of a UML model. The OCL
interpreter was developed using Java's reflection feature. OCL was
used as a query language (OQL - Object Query Language) to retrieve a
subset of any large UML model based on any specified OCL constraints.
This is useful to navigate large and complex UML models. A goal was to
create a proof of concept to use UML as a general purpose knowledge
modeling language and use ArgoUML as the capture, editing and
retrieval tool.

<p>
Enables real-time animated visualization of systems dynamics and
software execution in high-level UML design diagrams. An animation
framework named "Waltz" was created on top of GEF, and UML model
objects were animated in real-time while either the software resulting
from the model got executed or simply dynamic transitions were
visualized in the design model. It was like a visual tracing and
debugging system - animating, for instance, the state chart
transitions of objects, either in real-time or in design-time.

<b>Title:</b> Cognitive Support Features for Software Development Tools<br>
<b>Author:</b> Jason Elliot Robbins<br>
<b>Degree:</b> Doctor of Philosophy in Infomation and Computer Science<br>
<b>University:</b> University of California, Irvine, 1999<br>
<b>Advisor:</b> Professor David F. Redmiles<br>
<b>Abstract:</b>
<p>
Software design is a cognitively challenging task. Most software
design tools provide support for editing, viewing, storing, sharing,
and transforming designs, but lack support for the essential and
difficult cognitive tasks facing designers. These cognitive tasks
include decision making, decision ordering, and task-specific design
understanding. To date, software design tools have not included
features that specifically address key cognitive needs of designers,
in part, because there has been no practical method for developing and
evaluating these features.
</p>
<p>
This dissertation contributes a practical description of several
cognitive theories relevant to software design, a method for devising
cognitive support features based on these theories, a basket of
cognitive support features that are demonstrated in the context of a
usable software design tool called Argo/UML, and a reusable
infrastructure for building similar features into other design tools.
Argo/UML is an object-oriented design tool that includes several novel
features that address the identified cognitive needs of software
designers. Each feature is explained with respect to the cognitive
theories that inspired it and the set of features is evaluated with a
combination of heuristic and empirical techniques.

<b>Abstract:</b>
<p>
Design critiquing systems are a type of intelligent user interface
used to support human designers in decision making.
This paper places design critics in the larger context of
intelligent user interface approaches and surveys several
critiquing systems.
Each approach and system is evaluated with respect to a five-phase
design improvement process.
This paper concludes with a summary of the state of the art
in critiquing systems and recommendation for future 
research directions.

<b>Abstract:</b>
<p>
Domain-oriented design environments are cooperative
problem-solving systems that support designers in complex
design tasks. In this paper we present the facilities and
architecture of Argo, a domain-oriented design environment
for software architecture. Argos architecture is motivated
by the desire to achieve reuse and extensibility of the design
environment. It separates domain-neutral code from
domain-oriented code, which is distributed among intelligent
design materials as opposed to being centralized in the
design environment. Argos facilities are motivated by the
observed cognitive needs of designers. These facilities
extend previous work in design environments to support
reflection-in-action, opportunistic design, and comprehension
and problem-solving.
