<H1>ArgoUML in Google's Summer Of Code 2007</H1>

<p>
The ArgoUML project will apply for participation in the
<a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Google Summer of Code</a>
during 2007.
We hope that Google, once again, will allow us to participate.

<!--
TODO: This page was created by copying the GSOC2006 page. A lot of very
good formulations for students are kept but commented out. Once we are
approved by Google, we can again address students and uncomment these.
For now, this page is more a collection of suggested projects that we
discuss. /Linus

<p>
We are looking for enthusiastic students with a solid knowledge of Java,
who are interested in software development tools and modeling,
particularly the UML modeling language.
Most, although not all, tasks will be easier for those who already
have an working knowledge of the OMG's UML.</p>

<!-- 
those interested in 
Software Engineering or Systems Engineering,
tools for Software Engineering, and
communication within a Software Engineering project using UML.

<p>
This page include a list of suggested projects that the development team is
interested in mentoring, but we are happy to consider projects which are
not on this list if they are worthwhile.
<!--
If you'd like to suggest a different project, please contact the team so
that we can work with you to develop the strongest possible proposal for
evaluation.  There's also a more general list of development tasks which
have been suggested over time available in our 
<a href="jobjar.html">Job Jar</a> which may offer additional sources of
inspiration.

<h2>Handling of UML Profiles</h2>
<p>
UML Profiles is the foundation for extending UML.
There is initiatives to formalize their definition,
there are profiles that are implemented in other tools without
a formal definition.
</p>

<p>
What we would like is code that allows ArgoUML to:
  <ul>
    <li>load UML profiles and apply them to the work.</li>
    <li>include the most important existing UML profiles (SysML, BPM, ...).</li>
  </ul>
This may be one or two projects.
</p>

Volunteering mentors for this: Linus Tolke.
