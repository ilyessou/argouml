<a name="introduction_link"><h3>Introduction</h3></a>

This FAQ is provided with the hopes of being helpful for users using
ArgoUML for their projects.
<p>

It is a collection of tips and tricks from the ArgoUML users' mailing
lists (click
<a href="http://argouml.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">here</a>
to see the available lists).

It is not a complete overview but it does reflect the interests and
problems that the users have expressed on the mailing lists.

There are also some questions and answers that are not related to the
use of ArgoUML but to the ArgoUML project.

They are listed <a href="#project_related">here</a>.
<p>

The information is updated as the questions and answers are posted on
the mailing list.  A certain version of the FAQ is only loosely
connected to a specific version of ArgoUML but can show how a problem
is solved differently in the different versions. The current "stable"
version of ArgoUML can be found
<a href="http://argouml.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList">here</a>.
The current developer release can be found at the same place but
further down under development releases.

<DL>
<DT><a name="link1">What is ArgoUML?</a>
<DD>
ArgoUML is a Java based Universal Modeling Language tool. It is able to create and save most of the nine 
standard UML diagrams. More information on UML can be found <a href="http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/formal/uml.htm">here</a>.
ArgoUML also has the ability to reverse engineer compiling Java code and generate UML diagrams for it.

<p>
ArgoUML is made available under the <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/copyright/license.html">BSD</a> Open Source License.

<p>
ArgoUML is not production ready!
This means that the things you can't do will distract you, you will have problems that you won't 
have in commercial UML tools, and there is no one to blame for this. On the other hand, this also means that
you have the opportunity to fix your problems yourself.


<DT><a name="name_argouml">Where does the name ArgoUML come from?</a>
<DD>
This goes to the ancient history of ArgoUML when it was
Jason Robbins' project.
<p>
Jason Robbins writes:
<table border=0 cellpadding=12>
<tr>
<td>
I first learned programming back in the days of BASIC on the Apple
II. When TurboPascal arrived, it got me very excited about IDE's. I
later had a chance to work with two Smalltalk environments and UNIX
and emacs. I've always been interested in how some tools can be so
much better than others. I have also enjoyed doing rapid prototyping
and experimental programming.
<p>
I came to grad school with the intention of building a better software
development environment with an emphasis on the human aspects. What
makes some languages and IDE's more productive for people than others?
I initially set out to build a tool that would help software designers
experiment with alternative designs quickly.
<p>
At that time, all of the names of research projects in my research
group at UC Irvine were taken from Greek Mythology. I borrowed a book
on mythology and tried to find a tale of experimentation. The story of
Jason and the Argonauts seemed like a good match because my name was
Jason and exploration was close to experimentation as I could find. In
that myth, "Argo" is the name of the ship that they sailed.
<p>
The name "Argo" refers to the library of cognitive support features I
implemented (e.g., design critics, checklists, navigational
perspectives, etc.). I have also used it as the product line name for
some of the applications of that library. The Argo/UML tool is
actually the fourth in a series of tools I worked on that have
cognitive support features provided by the Argo library. Argo/UML is
by far the largest application of the Argo library.
<p>
I later learned more about the "Argo" myth and found an interesting
coincidence. The ship "Argo" was made from wood cut from a magical
talking tree. The beams of wood on the ship continued to talk and
warned the Argonauts of upcoming danger. You could say that these were
design critics!
<p>

</ul>


<DT><a name="manual_link">Is there a manual?</a>
<DD>Yes.
Look
<A HREF="http://argouml.tigris.org/documentation/defaulthtml/manual/">Here</A>.


<DT><a name="source_link">Where do I get the source code for ArgoUML?</a>
<DD>
You can download the source from the same server that you download the
application from.
<p>
There is an archive with all the source so you can look at it.
If you are aiming to build ArgoUML, download from the CVS repository instead.
You will then get the complete set of development tools and libraries
needed to build it. 
(The build scripts included in the archive does not really fit
the way the libraries are packaged so building ArgoUML from the archive
is really complicated and not recommended.)


<DT><a name="commer_link">Is there commercial support for ArgoUML?</a>
<DD>Not really.
Gentleware provides a product called <i>Poseidon</i> that is sold with support.

<p>
See <A HREF="http://www.gentleware.com">http://www.gentleware.com</A>.

<p>
Poseidon was originally ArgoUML but that was a long time ago and 
Gentleware has made a lot of improvements.
ArgoUML has also made improvements since then so the two
products have been diverging and are now very different.



<DT><a name="uml_versions">What versions of UML are supported?</a>
<DD>
We currently only support UML1.3.

<p>
There are various hurdles to get through before UML2.

<p>
We are currently using the NSUML model repository and this ties us to UML1.3.

<p>
By moving instead to JMI we will have an upgrade path.

<p>
The plans for moving to JMI are
<a href="http://argouml.tigris.org/project_schedule.html">here</a>
but due to the nature of open 
source development are subject to change at any time.

<p>
The current release plan only goes as far as replacing NSUML. Plans have not 
yet been finalized for how to progress from there.



<DT><a name="help_link">When I click on help I get sent to a server for example:
http://ics.uci.edu/pub/arch/uml/critics/CrMultipleAgg.html but there
isn't an ics.uci.edu server... Where can I get the help files?</a>
<DD>This was a stub for the help files that was never implemented.
It was so up until versions 0.10 of ArgoUML.
<P>
In versions 0.12 of ArgoUML this "feature" was turned off.
<P>
In version 0.14 you are directed to the User Manual where
this information is described.
The integration between the User Manual and the ArgoUML tools is currently
rather rudimentary. Among other things it needs to use the single big file
version of the user manual.

</DL>


<H3>OS Specific</H3>
<DL>
<DT><a name="osx_link">In OS X: How can I access the context sensitive menus?</a>
<DD>Press the Apple Key together with the mouse button


<DT><a name="osx_java">In OS X 10.2: How can I get ArgoUML to work?</a>
<DD>ArgoUML will not work out-of-the-box on MacOSX 10.2 for people who have the Apple Developer Tools installed, because those tools install Java 1.4.1.
<p>
There is a workaround, though: Apple leaves the 1.3.1 java engine installed, but in an obscure place. You can run ArgoUML from the Terminal window by typing
<p>
% /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.3.1/Commands/java -jar argouml.jar


<DT><a name="win_link">In Windows: How can I get ArgoUML to load when I double-click on a model file?</a>
<DD>The trick is to do things in two steps. First, open Windows Explorer and find a .zargo
file, and then right-click on it. You should get the normal Windows menu, including an Open or Open With 
option. At this point, give a description for the file like "ArgoUML Model", and tell Windows to use 
Notepad to open the file. That's not what you want to do ultimately, but it does get Windows to
accept the .zargo extension as representing a valid file type.
<p>
Now close, and then reopen Windows Explorer. If you are using a version of Windows prior to XP go to the Explorer menu and select View->Options. For XP you would use Tools->Folder Options. You should get a two (or more) tabbed dialog. Click the "File Types" dialog and
then scroll through the list for the Description you gave - in this example
"ArgoUML Model". Click to select that file type, and then click the "Edit"
button.
<p>
Now, click on the "Open" action and then the "Edit" button there. You will
then get a dialog that has a line for entering in the application action
that will have a line for using Notepad to open the file. Replace that line
with:
<p>
"C:\Program Files\Java\j2re1.4.1_01\bin\javaw.exe" -jar "c:\ArgoUML\argouml.jar" "%L"
<p>
Substitute your path to your JavaW.exe and ArgoUML.jar files if they aren't
located where specified above. Click OK, then click OK, then click OK (three buttons on
three different levels of the dialog).
<p>
You can now double-click on your model and have ArgoUML instantly loaded.


<DT><a name="unknownhostexception">In Linux: 
      I cannot start because of an java.net.UnknownHostException
    </a>
<DD>
ArgoUML uses 
InetAddress.getLocalHost()
to get a unique identifier on all elements that are to be created 
in that instance of ArgoUML.
This works for networked machines and for stand alone-machines.
However there are cases when the TCP/IP configuration is wrong
where this does not work.
<p>

The solution is, fix your network configuration.
<p>

If you want to suggest a better explanation or a fix within ArgoUML for this,
go through the java.net.InetAddress and find out 
what really happens in this case.

<A NAME="jws"><h3>Java Web Start (JWS)</h3></A>

<DT><a name="jwswhatisit" />What is JavaWebStart?</a>
<DD>
It is a way to download and install and launch java applications via
the web.  Once you have JWS installed, you can launch ArgoUML by
clicking on a link.  
You can also add an ArgoUML icon to your desktop.
If you are using the JWS file for the "latest" stable or development
release, you will automatically upgrade to new releases as they are
made available.
<P>
You will need to download and install Java Web Start though
(unless you are on Mac OS 10 where it is included).
<P>
For more information, see the <a
href="http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/">JavaWebStart product
page</a>.


<DT><a name="jwshowtoinstall" />How do I install JavaWebStart?</a>
<DD>
See the installation instructions on the Sun web site: 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/">JavaWebStart</a>.
<P>
In particular, note that Mozilla and Netscape 6.x 
users must take an additional step
to register the helper application in your browser preferences.


<DT><a name="jwsbadmime" />Web Start returns a Bad MIME Type error. What's wrong?</a>
<DD>
This is from 
<a href="http://www.vamphq.com/jwsfaq.html#badmimetype">the JWS FAQ at VampHQ</a>.

<P>This is a very common problem and most likely caused by Web Start's
failed attempt to automatically detect your proxy settings. The "Bad
MIME Type" error displayed by Web Start is somewhat confusing as it
should really be a "Resource Not Found" error.

<P>Your proxy will send back an error page either in HTML or plain
text instead of the requested JNLP descriptor if it fails to get the
JNLP descriptor requested by Web Start.

<P>You can change your proxy settings for Web Start manually by
starting the Application Manager and using the Preference
panel. (Select File|Preferences to get there.)

<DT><a name="jwsexpired" />It says that your certificate has expired.</a>
<DD>
Yeah, sorry about that.  We are looking into getting a new
certificate.  For now, just click the "Start" button that proceeds
with the expired certificate.


<DT><a name="jwsother" />Other problems.</a>
<DD>
If you have any other problem with JWS, please:

</ul>


<H3>Diagrams and Navigation</H3>
<DL>
<DT><a name="diag_link">How do I know what diagram I'm working on?</a>
<DD>If your screen is large enough, you will see the name
of the diagram in the top right corner.


<DT><a name="actor_link">How can I sort the artifacts in the Navigation Pane, for example
sort all of my Actors?</a>
<DD>That is not currently supported.


<DT><a name="elem_link">How do I arrange my diagram elements?</a>
<DD>There are several ways to easily and elegantly move diagram elements.

<p>
Select the elements you want to move. By holding down the control key
you can select several.

<p>
Now hit your arrow keys. Your elements move a little with every key stroke.

<p>
If you also hold down the shift key, they move a bit faster.

<p>
Or click on the broom button, move your mouse to the diagram pane,
right click and hold. Now moving your mouse side ways (or up and down)
will align elements.

<p>
There also is the menu item <b>Arrange</b> where you can align, group or
nudge (move a little bit) elements.


<DT><a name="sequence_diagrams_not_working">
      Why don't the sequence diagrams work?
    </a>
<DD>In 0.10.1 they should be working.
This implementation is however not faithful to UML,
nor to the look and feel of the rest of ArgoUML.
<p>

In 0.12 there are problems with the sequence diagrams.
Among other things the arrow heads does not appear.
<p>

In 0.14 the sequence diagrams are completely turned off and should not
be working.
<p>

In 0.16 a new implementation will be made.
We are very eager for this new implementation to work correctly so
if you can <a href="#helpdeveloping">help</a> with this, 
monitor the news items and announcements of development releases
for the progress of this feature and test it ruthlessly when available.
If you want to do more,
discuss with Jaap Branderhorst that is responsible for this work.


<DT><a name="ord_link">I'm trying to change the ordering of the links in the sequence
diagram. How do I do that?</a>
<DD>That is not currently supported.


<DT><a name="state_link">How do I create a state diagram?</a>
<DD>Select a class, then you can create a state diagram.
The same applies for activity diagrams.


<DT><a name="act_link">How do I create an activity diagram?</a>
<DD>Select a use case or class, then you can create an activity
diagram. Same as for a state diagram.


<DT><a name="note_link">I see there is a note icon in the tool bar. How do I use it?</a>
<DD>Click on your target class.
Then click on the note icon.
ArgoUML will generate the link automatically.

<p>
You can also right click to add a note as well!

<p>
Be aware that your note will not appear in the source code
documentation tab but it will appear in the diagram view of the
navigation pane (the left pane tree view).


<DT><a name="easy_link">What is the easiest way to enter data into attributes and methods window for classes?</a>
<DD>Click direct class properties pane and start typing. 


<DT><a name="model_link">Where can I find some sample ArgoUML models?</a>
<DD>There are some models at:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://argouml.tigris.org/models/addisonwesley/UMLDistilled.zargo">http://argouml.tigris.org/models/addisonwesley/UMLDistilled.zargo</a>
<li><a href="http://argouml.tigris.org/models/omg/uml13.zargo">http://argouml.tigris.org/models/omg/uml13.zargo</a>

<li><a href="http://argouml.tigris.org/models/oreilly/nutshell4.zargo">http://argouml.tigris.org/models/oreilly/nutshell4.zargo</a>
</ul>
Alas they are very old and also reported not to be working.
This is one of the things where we need to 
<A HREF="#helpdeveloping">do more work</A>.
</DL>

<H3>XMI and other formats</H3>
<DL>
<DT><a name="xmia_link">Does ArgoUML save .xmi files?</a>
<DD>Yes.
It saves the model information in an .xmi-file,  the diagram information in a .pgml-file and 
information about the project in a .argo file.
All of these are then zipped to a .zargo-file. 
You can easily extract the .xmi from the .zargo file using jar.
<p>
The version 0.14 of ArgoUML has a function in the menu under "Tools" to export an XMI file.

<DT><a name="xmib_link">How do I import an .xmi into ArgoUML and what formats are known to be
supported?</a>
<DD>Because of the variety of .xmi formats being generated you will
encounter problems using other .xmis generated from other
applications.
ArgoUML's native storage format is another implementation of XMI (Curt
Arnold believes that it has been hacked so it can also read the Unisys
variant).
He recommends that if you are comfortable with XSLT, you can typically
transform one variant of UML + XMI to another, plus MetaIntegrations
(<a href="http://www.metaintegration.net">http://www.metaintegrations.net</a>) makes a version of their Bridge
product available to transform between XMI flavors.


<DT><a name="rose_link">Can ArgoUML read an MDL file generated by Rational Rose?</a>
<DD>No.
MDL is a Rational Rose-specific format.
You are much better off getting Rose to export an XMI file.

<p>
Rose has an add-on that can create XMI format from an MDL file that is available <a href="http://www.rational.com/support/downloadcenter/addins/media/rose/xml_133.zip">here</a>.

<p>
You will then need a tool to convert that .XMI to a version that ArgoUML understands.


<DT><a name="addtag_link">I have a project where I need to add tags to attributes. How do I do that?</a>
<DD>Open the zargo file with any zip application and you'll find the XMI inside. If you want to convert it to XSD then go to <a href="http://xmlmodeling.com/">http://xmlmodeling.com/</a> (Dave Carlson's site) and convert the XMI there.


<DT><a name="gentle_link">I have a Gentleware project. How do I convert it to ArgoUML?</a>
<DD>If you don't have sequence diagrams in your project you can do the following to convert a Gentleware Project for use with ArgoUML:<p>
0) Make sure to backup your project first.<p>
1) Unpack the Gentleware project Project.zargo. example : (unzip Project.zargo) or (jar xvf Project.zargo)<p>
2) Then try reading and then saving the project with an appropriate UML Tool.<p>
3) Repackage the project. example (zip NewProject.zargo *.xmi *.pgml *.argo) or (jar cvf NewProject.zargo *)<p>
4) You should now be able to read the project with ArgoUML.<p>
</DL>

<H3>Printing and Graphics</H3>
<DL>
<DT><a name="print_link">How can I print my diagrams?</a>
<DD>Select a diagram, then go to File-&#62;Export Diagrams. You can
generate gif, postscript, eps or .svg format.


<DT><a name="svg_link">What does SVG stand for?</a>
<DD>A super cool vector graphics format (like MM Flash) that is
totally open and is gaining enormous ground in the graphics
world. Find out more at the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/Overview.htm8">www.W3C.org</a>.


<DT><a name="savsvg_link">How do I save my diagram as .SVG?</a>
<DD>First: select .svg as the file type.
Second: type the name of the file as you like with the .svg tag at the end.
Example myumldiagram.svg


<DT><a name="eps_link">Can I save my diagram as EPS <B>with</B> a preview image?</a>
<DD>No.


<DT><a name="output_link">Can I output my entire project as an HTML?</a>
<DD>No.


<DT><a name="part_link">Can I control what part of a diagram that shall be saved so as to only
save a fraction?</a>
<DD>No. You will have to edit the image after saving.


<DT><a name="xmic_link">Does ArgoUML generate an XMI document?</a>
<DD>Yes!
It is one of the files zipped into the save file (the .zargo file).

<DT><a name="bunch_link">I've got a bunch of people working on the same diagrams. 
How do I track who is doing what on the diagram?
How do I use ArgoUML with CVS?</a>
<DD>You can't.
ArgoUML works as if the .zargo files is a single binary file.
If several users open it at once to do work some work will be lost.


<DT><a name="sanity_link">Is there a mechanism to do a sanity check in ArgoUML and enforce that sanity check?</a> 
<DD>Yes, by paying attention to the to do items
generated by the critics.
They will give you ideas on what the problems are with your model
and sometimes help you in fixing them.
<P>
ArgoUML follows the policy that the user in the end knows more than 
the developers of ArgoUML do.
A level of sanity enough to be able to draw and save the model is maintained
by ArgoUML but beyond that the user can do what he pleases
as long as he ignores (or turns of) the critics with suggestions.


<DT><a name="empty_zargo">I saved a project from ArgoUML,
and then when I opened it later ArgoUML said it was empty. 
What can I do?</a> 
<DD>Often the problem is a null character or an accent. ArgoUML still doesn't deal very well with problems related to these characters. There is also some discussion of addressing this problem in a future version of ArgoUML.


<DT><a name="strange_language">I started ArgoUML and it is in
Russion/Spanish/French/German.
Why? How can I configure it so it will be in English?</a> 
<DD>ArgoUML attempts to detect the language settings from your
environment and start with the language you prefer.
<p>
There are two known problems with this approach:<ul>
<li>The quality of some of the translations is poor and
ArgoUML will, because of that, present a mix between English and the
configured language.
<li>If you are borrowing someone else's computer or working in
an foreign office you might not understand the GUI.
</ul>
There are two possible solutions:<ul>
<li>Reconfigure the environment to work in your language (or English)
and restart ArgoUML.
<li>Force ArgoUML to use the language of your choice.
For the upcoming 0.16 version of ArgoUML there will be one Java Web
Start target for some of the languages.
Then you can use the target for English.
Until then you will have to install argouml locally and start it 
with forcing the language.
Like this:
<pre>
java -Duser.language=en -jar argouml.jar
</pre>
</ul>

<H3>Project-related questions</H3>
<DL>
<DT><a name="bug_link">Where and how do I report bugs?</a>
<DD>You report bugs by entering them into Issuezilla.
Bugs are called defects.
Issuezilla also contains feature and enhancement requests.

<P>
How you do this is explained on the
<a href="http://argouml.tigris.org/project_bugs.html">
  How to Report Bugs and register enhancements
</a>
page.

<P>
You don't need to ask on any mailing list 
if it is a problem,
if it is already known, or
if it is has a solution.
If you are having problems, assume that there really is a problem!
If you are wrong and it is not really a problem, you will get notified by
someone that resolves the issue (as INVALID, WORKSFORME, or FIXED).
If you can't find it in Issuezilla, assume that no-one else has reported it!
If the bug was already known and reported but you didn't find it, 
you will get notified by someone that resolves the issue (as DUPLICATE).
It might be that it is filed under a completely different problem
description since the same problem might manifest itself in different ways.

<DT><a name="repbug_link">What information is interesting when reporting a Bug?</a>
<DD>Get a screen capture of it and a .txt copy of the stack output for analysis.

<p>
Also include what version of ArgoUML you are running and on what platform.
Useful information includes:
<ul>
<li>OS - Which OS, which version, and which patches
<li>Java-version - 
      Including whether you are running a development version or 
      runtime version
<li>Hardware - 
      Processor and processor speed, 
      Memory, 
      Hard Drive space, and 
      free hard drive space
</ul>
It is also helpful if you can upload the zargo project file for the project that is having problems.
<p>


<DT><a name="enhance_link">How do I suggest an enhancement?</a>
<DD>
You proceed exactly as when reporting the bug including a search to see
if someone else has already suggested that.
<P>
How you do this is explained on the
<a href="http://argouml.tigris.org/project_bugs.html">
  How to Report Bugs and register enhancements
</a>
page.

<DT><a name="attach_file">Something is happening when I run ArgoUML that's hard to describe. How should I send a picture or document describing it?</a>
<DD>
It is probably a bug.
Write a defect report and attach your picture or document
as part of a defect report.
Reporting bugs is described <a href="#bug_link">earlier in the FAQ</a>.
<p>
If you have successfully reported the problem in Issuezilla 
there is no need to send an email about it.
The discussion and investigation will take place in that issue in Issuezilla.


<DT><a name="vote_link">How do I indicate that I think an enhancement or fix is important?</a>
<DD>
You vote for the issue.
<ul>
<li>Login to the Tigris site
<li>Find the issue that you are interested in
<li>Click on the Vote for this issue link 
directly above the Additional Comments field
</ul>
After having voted for an issue you will receive mails when something
happens to the issue.
This is unless you have turned it off in your Issuezilla settings.
<P>
Your votes helps the developers of ArgoUML to know what defects are the
most important to solve and what features are the most important to add.

<DT><a name="vtcount_link">How do I see how many votes have been cast for an enhancement or fix?</a>
<DD>You can query for all issues that have at least one vote 
by entering "1" in the At least ____ votes field and 
clicking on the Submit query button.
You will get a list of all issues that have 
at least one vote cast for them.
By following the link to the issue, you can adjust your votes as you see fit.

<P>
Another way is to change the columns shown by Issuezilla list to include the
Votes column.


<DT><a name="magic_link">Why isn't there any magic controlling this FAQ where the questions and
answers are automatically generated and my problem always appear on the top
of the list?</a>
<DD>Because the developers of the ArgoUML project don't know where such
functions can be found and have not had the patience to set it up.
