<title>Frequently asked questions for ArgoUML.</title>
<H2>Frequently asked questions for ArgoUML.</H2>

This FAQ is provided with the hopes to be helpful for users using
ArgoUML for their projects.

<p>
It is a collection of tips and tricks from the users mailing lists.
It is by no means a complete overview ubut does rather reflect the
interest and problems that the users have expressed on the mailing list.

<p>
The information is updated as the questions and answers are posted on
the mailing list.
A certain version of the FAQ is only loosely connected to a specific
version of ArgoUML but can rather elaborate on how a
problem is solved differently in the different versions.

<DL>
<DT>What is ArgoUML?
<DD>
ArgoUML is Java based Universal Modeling Language tool.
It is able to create and save most of the nine UML diagrams.
It has the ability to reverse engineer compiling java code and
generate UML diagrams for it.

<p>
It is available under BSD Open Source License.

<p>
ArgoUML is not production ready!
This means that you will get distracted by the things you can't do,
you will have problems that you won't have in commercial UML tools,
and there is noone to blame for this.

<DT><A NAME="helpdeveloping">How can I help?</A>
<DD>
Welcome, welcome, welcome, you are most welcome!

<p>
Level 1: Use it! Talk about it! Test it! Find bugs! Report bugs!

<p>
Level 2: Help in pin-pointing and fixing bugs!
Dive into Issuezilla!
Become a developer of ArgoUML!
Make improvements!
Discuss what you want to work on on the developers mailing list.

<DT>Is there a manual?
<DD>Yes.
Look
<A HREF="http://argouml.tigris.org/documentation/defaulthtml/manual/">Here</A>.

<DT>What is Java Web Start (JWS)?
<DD>It is a technology that allows you to start the application directly
from the web.
You don't need to bother about downloading, unpacking, installing, 
or keeping track of updates.
You just run the applications.
<P>
You need to download and install Java Web Start though
(unless you are on Mac OS 10 where it is included).

<DT>Where do I get the source code for ArgoUML?
<DD>You can download the source from the same server as you download the
applications.

<DT>Is there commercial support for ArgoUML?
<DD>Sort of, Gentleware provides an enhanced versions of ArgoUML 
called Poseidon that is sold with support.

<p>
See <A HREF="http://www.gentleware.com">http://www.gentleware.com</A>

<DT>When I click on help I get sent to a server for example:
http://ics.uci.edu/pub/arch/uml/critics/CrMultipleAgg.html but there
isn't an ics.uci.edu server... Where can I get the help files?
<DD>There never was any such help files.
<P>
In later versions of ArgoUML this feature is turned off.
Eventually you will be directed to the User Manual where
this information is described but that function is not in
place either.

<P>
This is one of the things where we need to

<DT>In OS X: How can I access the context sensitive menus?
<DD>Press the Apple Key together with the mouse button

<DT>How do I know what diagram I'm working on?
<DD>If your screen is large enough, you will see the name
of the diagram in the top right corner.

<DT>How can I sort the artifacts in the Navigation Pane, for example
sort all of my Actors?
<DD>You cant.

<DT>How do I arrange my diagram elements?
<DD>There are several ways to easily and elegantly move diagram elements.

<p>
Select the elements you want to move. By holding down the control key
you can select several.

<p>
Now hit your arrow keys. Your elements move a little with every key stroke.

<p>
If you also hold down the shift key, they move a bit faster.

<p>
Or click on the broom button, move your mouse to the diagram pane,
right click and hold. Now moving your mouse side ways (or up and down)
will align elements.

<p>
There also is the menu item arrange where you can align, group or
nudge (move a little bit) elements.

<DT>I'm trying to change the ordering of the links in the sequence
diagram. How do I do that?
<DD>You can't.

<DT>How do I create a state diagram?
<DD>Select a class, then you can create a state diagram.
The same applies for activity diagrams.

<DT>I am trying to use ArgoUML to edit a state machine diagram for a
model. But when I edit a composite state, I don't know how to provide
do and event for a composite state. Can you help me?
<DD>Select a class, then you can create a state diagram.

<DT>How do I create an activity diagram?
<DD>Select a use case or class, then you can create an activity
diagram. Same as for a state diagram.

<DT>I see there is a note icon in the tool bar. How do I use it?
<DD>Click on your target class.
Then click on the note icon.
ArgoUML will generate the link automatically.

<p>
You can also right click to add a note as well!

<p>
Be aware that your note will not appear in the source code
documentation tab but it will appear in the diagram view of the
navigation pane (the left pane tree view).

<DT>What is the easiet way to enter data into attributes and methods window for classes?
<DD>Click direct class properties pane and start typing. 

<DT>Do ArgoUML save .xmi files?
<DD>Yes.
They save the model information in an .xmi-file, 
the diagram information in a .pgml-file and information about the
project in a .argo file.
All of these are then zipped to a .zargo-file. 
You can easily extract the .xmi from the .zargo file using jar.

<DT>How do I import an .xmi into ArgoUML and what formats are known to be
supported?
<DD>Because of the variety of .xmi formats being generated you will
encounter problems using other .xmis generated from other
applications.
ArgoUML's native storage format is another implementation of XMI (Curt
Arnold believes that it has been hacked so it can also read the Unisys
variant).
He recommends that if you are comfortable with XSLT, you can typically
transform one variant of UML + XMI to another, plus MetaIntegrations
(http://www.metaintegrations.net) makes a version of their Bridge
product available to transform between XMI flavors.

<DT>Can ArgoUML read an MDL file generated by Rational Rose?
<DD>No.
MDL is a Rational Rose-specific format.
If you can get Rational Rose to export in XMI format and you are
much better off.

<DT>How can I print my diagrams?
<DD>Select a diagram, then go to File-&#62;Export Diagrams. You can
generate gif, postscript, eps or .svg format.

<DT>What does SVG stand for?
<DD>A super cool vector graphics format (like MM Flash) that is
totally open and is gaining enormous ground in the graphics
world. Find out more at the www.W3C.org.

<DT>How do I save my diagram as .SVG?
<DD>First: select .svg as the file type.
Second: type the name of the file as you like with the .svg tag at the end.
Example myumldiagram.svg

<DT>Can I save my diagram as EPS <B>with</B> a preview image?
<DD>No.

<DT>Can I output my entire project as an HTML?
<DD>No.

<DT>Can I control what part of a diagram that shall be saved so as to only
save a fraction?
<DD>No. You will have to edit the image afterwards.

<DT>Does ArgoUML generate an XMI document?
<DD>Yes!
It is one of the files zipped into the save file (the .zargo file).
Unpack with jar.

<DT>Where/how do I report bugs?
<DD>Bugs are called defects.
They are stored in Issuezilla together with suggestion of new features 
and enhancements.

<P>
First see if someone else has reported the same bug by
<A HREF="http://argouml.tigris.org/issues/query.cgi">searching in Issuezilla</A>.
If so, add you additional observations as comments to that bug.

<P>
If you can't find it there 
<A HREF="http://argouml.tigris.org/issues/enter_bug.cgi?issue_type=DEFECT">report it</A>.

<p>
You need to be a registered user at Tigris and have an Observer role
in the ArgoUML project to do this.


<DT>What information is interesting when reporting a Bug
<DD>Get a screen grab of it and a .txt copy of the stack output for analysis.

<p>
Also include what version of ArgoUML you are running and on what platform (Hardware, OS, Java-version).

<DT>I've got a bunch of people working on the same diagrams. 
How do I track who is doing what on the diagram?
How do I use ArgoUML with CVS?
<DD>You can't.
ArgoUML works as if the .zargo files is a single binary file.
If several users open it at once to do work some work will be lost.

<DT>Why isn't there any magic controling this FAQ where the questions and
answers are automatically generated and my problem always appear on the top
of the list?
<DD>Because the developers of the ArgoUML project don't know where such
functions can be found and have not had the patience to set it up.
