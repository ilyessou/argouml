<h2>Internationalization teams</h2>

<P>
The following people are committed to do the internationalization 
and localization work in the ArgoUML project.
<P>
Each group is responsible for all issues regarding a certain 
language/region/country.

<UL>
  <LI>
    <STRONG>(default) English (American English)</STRONG>
    <br>
    All developers maintain this while working with the code.
    <br>
    For ArgoUML the default language is American English (en_US).
    This is to be used in all non-localized texts.
    <br>
    Notice that javadoc comments and variable names,
    log messages (through log4j and System.out),
    and
    design documentation (cookbook and web site),
    are not localized but always written in American English 
    (en_US).
    This means that all developers of ArgoUML must know English.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    <STRONG>(en) English</STRONG>
    <br>
    All developers maintain this while working with the code.
    <br>
    en defaults in ArgoUML to the English spoken in America (en_US).
  </LI>
  <LI>
    <STRONG>(fr) French - Francais</STRONG>
    <UL>
      <LI>Jean-Hugues de Raigniac
      <LI>Luc Maisonobe
    </UL>
    fr defaults in ArgoUML to the French spoken in France (fr_FR).
  </LI>
  <LI>
    <STRONG>(ru) Russian</STRONG>
    <UL>
      <LI>Alexey Aphanasyev
    </UL>
    ru defaults in ArgoUML to the Russian spoken in Russia (ru_RU).
  <LI>
    <STRONG>(de) German - Deutch</STRONG>
    <UL>
      <LI>Achim Spangler
    </UL>
    de defaults in ArgoUML to the German spoken in Berlin (?) (de_??).
  <LI>
    <STRONG>(es) Spanish</STRONG>
    <UL>
      <LI>Ricardo Varela
    </UL>
    es defaults in ArgoUML to the Spanish spoken in Spain (es_ES).
  </LI>

  <LI>
    <STRONG>(ca) Catalan</STRONG>
    <UL>
      <LI>Marc Valerio i Brau
    </UL>
    ca defaults in ArgoUML to the Catalan spoken in Spain (ca_ES).
  </LI>

  <LI>
    <STRONG>(en_GB) English as spoken in Great Britain</STRONG>
    <UL>
      <LI>Jeremy Bennett
    </UL>
  </LI>

</UL>
For each language there is always a default region/country that is listed
here.
Secondary regions/countries (as en_GB) can be started but must
be for a different region than the default one.

<h2>Comments on the work of the teams</h2>
<P>
All internationalization effort suffer the problem that the 
internationalization in the code is not complete.
I (Linus Tolke) suggest that all teams make the internationalization
of the code their first priority and their respective languages
their second priority.
Jean-Hugues de Raigniac coordinates the work with completing the
internationalization throughout the code.
<P>
On the other hand it is not really that simple because 
in order to find the places where the
code is not complete you have to work with an ArgoUML where
all the property files has been translated so you have a lot of
translation work in order to get there.
<P>
Suggested work order for each team:
<OL>
<LI>Complete localization of ArgoUML excluding GEF-parts (priority 2).
    When a problem with the code is encountered, report it in Issuezilla
    and help in solving it (priority 1).
<LI>Complete localization of GEF (work with the GEF team).
<LI>Quality assurance, making sure that the terms used match 
the translations used in books in the domain.
<LI>Following up on the new development of ArgoUML.
The checkstyle tools reports when a tag is missing from a specific
language i.e. when there is a missmatch between the non-localized file
and any localized file. 
Check and fix that regularly for your language!
