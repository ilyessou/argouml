<h2>Internationalization teams in ArgoUML</h2>

<P>
The following people are committed to do the internationalization 
and localization work in the ArgoUML project.
<P>
Each group is responsible for all issues regarding a certain 
language/region/country.

<UL>
  <LI>
    <STRONG>(default, en) English (American English)</STRONG>
    <br>
    All developers maintain this while working with the code.
    <br>
    For ArgoUML the default language is American English (en_US).
    This is to be used in all non-localized texts.
    <br>
    Notice that javadoc comments and variable names,
    log messages (through log4j and System.out),
    and
    design documentation (cookbook and web site),
    are not localized but always written in American English 
    (en_US).
    This means that all developers of ArgoUML must know English.
    <br>
    Notice also that there is no (en) files.
    They are not needed since it is the default.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    <STRONG>(fr) French - Français</STRONG>
    <UL>
      <LI>jhraigniac (Jean-Hugues de Raigniac)

    <UL>
      <LI>alexb (Alex Bagehot)
    </UL>
    en_GB is English as spoken in Great Britain.
  </LI>

</UL>
For each language there is always a default region/country that is listed
here.
Secondary regions/countries (as fr_CA) could be started but must
be for a different region than the default one.
