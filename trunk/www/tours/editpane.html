<P>ArgoUML's Editing Pane is the main work area. 
You use this pane to edit diagrams. To this end, it contains a toolbar at the
top, which contains all items (ModelElement) 
that can be drawn on the current type of diagram.
Clicking on a tool-icon in the toolbar selects the type of ModelElement 
that will be placed by a simple click in the diagram area.
The toolbar also contains some general drawing tools, for diagram decoration
with lines, text, and shapes, which are not part of the UML model.
