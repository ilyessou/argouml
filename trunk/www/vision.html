<H3>Cognitive Support for Design</H3>
<P>Software design is a cognitively challenging task. Designers must manually enter
designs, but the primary difficulty is decision-making rather than data-entry. If designers improved their decision-making
capabilities, it would result in better designs.</P>
<P>Current CASE tools provide automation and graphical user interfaces that reduce
the manual work of entering a design and transforming a design into code. They aid designers in decision-making
mainly by providing visualization of design diagrams and simple syntactic checks. Also many CASE tools provide
substantial benefits in the area of version control and concurrent design mechanisms. One area of design support
that has been not been well supported is analysis of design decisions.</P>
<P>Current CASE tools are usable in that they provide a GUI that allows designers
to access all the features provided by the tool. And they support the design process in that they allow the designer
to enter diagrams in the style of popular design methodologies. But they typically do not provide process support
to guide the designer through the design task. Instead, designers typically start with a blank page and must remember
to cover every aspect of the design.</P>
<P>ArgoUML is a domain-oriented design environment that provides cognitive support
of object-oriented design. ArgoUML provides some of the same automation features of a commercial CASE tool, but
it focuses on features that support the cognitive needs of designers. These cognitive needs are described by three
cognitive theories:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>reflection-in-action,
	<LI>opportunistic design, and
	<LI>comprehension and problem solving.
</UL>

<P>
<H3>Following the UML Specification</H3>
<P>ArgoUML is based directly on the UML 1.3 specification. In fact, a large part of
ArgoUML was generated automatically from the UML specification. ArgoUML is (to the best of our knowledge) the only
tool that implements the UML meta-model exactly as specified. In contrast, current commercial tools use tools use
basically the same internal representation of the design that they used in previous versions.</P>
<P>Furthermore, it is our goal to provide comprehensive support for OCL (the Object
Constraint Language) and XMI (the XML Model Interchange format), which other tools currently do not support.</P>
<P>
<H3>Community Software Development</H3>
<P>As with all software produced by our research group, ArgoUML is available for free
and can be used in commercial settings. For terms of use, see the license agreement presented when you download
ArgoUML.</P>
<P>ArgoUML was originally developed by a small group of people as a research project.
ArgoUML has many features that make it special, but it does not implement all the features that commercial CASE
tools provide. We are providing the source code for ArgoUML for you to review, customize to your needs, and improve.
Over time, we hope that ArgoUML will evolve into a powerful and useful tool for everyone to use.</P>
<P>Community software development has worked successfully to produce the FSF's GNU
utilities and the Linux operating system. It has also worked in producing <A HREF="http://gef.tigris.org/">GEF</A>, the Graph Editing Framework, which is a major
component of ArgoUML.</P>
