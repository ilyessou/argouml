<H2>ArgoUML History</H2>
This is the ArgoUML History depicted as a timeline.
Currently it is very incomplete because the initial author (Linus Tolke)
don't know that much about the ancient history of ArgoUML.
Hopefully some of the persons that has been around for long (Jason,
Marko, Toby...) can fill in the blanks and questions marks and answer
the questions.

The Argo family of domain oriented design environments was
created and ArgoUML was made part of it.
This family of tools was developed for over three years.
Other tools in the family support C2-style software architectures and
requirements engineering.
All tools in the Argo family allow for construction of design
artifacts and provide decision-support features to help designers make
better designs.
Domain-indepentent features of the Argo infrastructure include:
critics, user models, the &quot;to do&quot; list metaphor, checklists,
multiple perspectives.
<P>
What happened to this family of tools then? Is ArgoUML the only
remains or are there other tools?
