I will do a little more collecting before I do that so

Hi Linus,

The problem is that this was a privat request, so i think
my company is not happy if the name COMPANY is used. You can use - of
course - my name (excect the email-adress and the name COMPANY)
in the statements. 

I'm sorry that i can't support more and thanks a lot to
ask for that.



Best Reguards,


Carsten

I have found ArgoUML at sourceforge and must say that
this is realy smart. I am one of those developers who
has written software years before UML coming up, so
I dont have any experince with it.

I recently started to use ArgoUML as my UML tool of choice ... :-)
and a very nice one at that...
