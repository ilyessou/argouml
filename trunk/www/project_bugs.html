To enter an issue, you must be a registered and logged in member
on Tigris.
To follow up issues it is required that you apply for an Observer role in
the ArgoUML and get it granted.

      <li><a href="http://argouml.tigris.org/issues/enter_bug.cgi?issue_type=DEFECT&component=argouml">Report a bug in ArgoUML</a>.
        <p>
      Here is a step by step instruction on what to do:
        <ol>
         <li>Search for the problem among the problems in the database.
         <li>If found, add yourself as CC to the Issue and vote for it.
         You can then monitor its progress. You are done.
         <li>If your problem is not found or some of your peculiarities
         or details is not included in the description, go on.
         <li>Enter a new issue or add information to an already existing issue.
         Be sure to include 
           what version of ArgoUML you are running, 
           what version of jdk,
           all the steps that lead up to this,
           what happens,
           what you expected to happen, and
           what the problem is.
         <li>If the problem is repeatable, rerun with debug logging enabled
         (<tt>java -Dlog4j.configuration=org/argouml/resource/full.lcf -jar argouml.jar</tt>)
         and add the log file <tt>argo_full.log</tt> from your home
         directory to the issue.
         <li>Add extra information that might be relevant for the issue 
         as attachments.
         These could be 
           screen shots,
           your project file,
           log files...
         <li>You will get updates via mail when someone comments or does
         something with your issue.
         <li>When it is resolved and verified, close the issue after you have 
         accepted the solution.
       <ol>
      </li>
      <li><a href="http://argouml.tigris.org/issues/enter_bug.cgi?issue_type=ENHANCEMENT&component=argouml">Suggest an enhancement of ArgoUML</a>
      <p>
      This is if you have suggestion on more things that you think ArgoUML
      should do for you that it currently does not do.
      Consider it our common wish list.
      </li>
      <li><a href="http://argouml.tigris.org/issues/enter_bug.cgi?issue_type=DEFECT&component=website">Report a bug on the web site</a>

<h3>Why you should do this</h3>
By reporting bugs you are contributing to the ArgoUML project and
your help will lead to making ArgoUML a better product.
<p>
By voting you are showing your interest and help the active developers
get a good idea of what is important and what is not.
<p>
By suggesting enhancements you are in fact helping with ideas for some
future version of ArgoUML.
<p>
If you want to contribute even more to the project
you should start with verifying, and resolving bugs.
