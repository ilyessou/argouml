		<TD>We are seeking about 14 usability test subjects to help us measurethe usability of one of the diagramming features
			of the Argo/UML tool. Subjects will need to come to the UCI campus in Irvine, California for a one hour session.
			Usability testing will consist of you doing prespecified diagramming tasks while we take measurements of the time,
			number of mouse clicks, etc. Subjects will also be asked to fill in a questionnaire about their experience with
			diagramming tools and their thoughts on the experimental diagramming tools.<BR>
			<BR>
			This is not a medical study, and there are no expected health benefits or risks. All collected data will be kept
			anonymous.<BR>
			<BR>
			There is no compensation for participating in this usablity study. However, you will be helping to advance the
			research project that is responsible for the development of Argo/UML and encouraging the development of other high
			quality software.<BR>
			<BR>
			For more information or to participate, please contact Jason Robbins, <A HREF="mainto:jrobbins=study@ics.uci.edu">jrobbins@ics.uci.edu</A>,
			(714) 824-7308. Mr. Robbins is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Information and Computer Science, University
			of California, Irvine.</TD>
