This directory contains the configuration for checkstyle. This 
configuration is a reflection of the agreed coding styles described
in the Standards for Coding in ArgoUML chapter in the Cookbook.


Noted problems with the current version of checkstyle (Linus 2003-06-30):
* Indentation
  The indentation used is some contributed indentation checker and not the
  real thing. Bugs found sofar:
	static blocks has 8 indents for some statements and 4 for others.
        inline classes (whatever they are called), checkstyle does not agree
	with emacs. More investigation needed on what is write and what is 
	wrong.
* LineLength: I have tried to have several ignoreLine patterns but it 
  doesn't seem to work. Hopefully one works.
