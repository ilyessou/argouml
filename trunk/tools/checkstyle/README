This directory contains the configuration for checkstyle. This 
configuration is a reflection of the agreed coding styles described
in the Standards for Coding in ArgoUML chapter in the Cookbook.


Noted problems with the current version of checkstyle (Linus 2003-06-30):
* Indentation
  The indentation used is some contributed indentation checker and not the
  real thing. Bugs found sofar:
	static blocks has 8 indents for some statements and 4 for others.
        inline classes (whatever they are called), checkstyle does not agree
	with emacs. More investigation needed on what is right and what is 
	wrong.
  (Is this still true?  Checkstyle 3.3 appears to agree with Eclipse 3.1
  on the correct indentation.  tfm 20051108)
