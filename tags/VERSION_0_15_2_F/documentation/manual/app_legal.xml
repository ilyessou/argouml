  <sect1 label="I">
    <title>REQUIREMENTS ON BOTH UNMODIFIED AND MODIFIED VERSIONS</title>

    <para>The Open Publication works may be reproduced and distributed in whole
      or in part, in any medium physical or electronic, provided that the terms
      of this license are adhered to, and that this license or an incorporation
      of it by reference (with any options elected by the author(s) and/or
      publisher) is displayed in the reproduction.</para>

    <para>Proper form for an incorporation by reference is as follows:</para>

    <blockquote><para>Copyright (c) &lt;year&gt; by &lt;author's name or
      designee&gt;.  This material may be distributed only subject to the terms
      and conditions set forth in the Open Publication License, vX.Y or later
      (the latest version is presently available at <ulink
      url="http://www.opencontent.org/openpub/">
      http://www.opencontent.org/openpub/</ulink>).</para></blockquote>

    <para>The reference must be immediately followed with any options elected
      by the author(s) and/or publisher of the document (see section
      VI).</para>

    <para>Commercial redistribution of Open Publication-licensed material is
      permitted.</para>

    <para>Any publication in standard (paper) book form shall require the
      citation of the original publisher and author. The publisher and author's
      names shall appear on all outer surfaces of the book.  On all outer
      surfaces of the book the original publisher's name shall be as large as
      the title of the work and cited as possessive with respect to the
      title.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 label="II">
    <title>COPYRIGHT</title>

    <para>The copyright to each Open Publication is owned by its author(s) or
      designee.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 label="III">
    <title>SCOPE OF LICENSE</title>

    <para>The following license terms apply to all Open Publication works,
      unless otherwise explicitly stated in the document.</para>

    <para>Mere aggregation of Open Publication works or a portion of an Open
      Publication work with other works or programs on the same media shall not
      cause this license to apply to those other works.  The aggregate work
      shall contain a notice specifying the inclusion of the Open Publication
      material and appropriate copyright notice.</para>

    <para>SEVERABILITY. If any part of this license is found to be
      unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the remaining portions of the license
      remain in force.</para>

    <para>NO WARRANTY. Open Publication works are licensed and provided
      <quote>as is</quote> without warranty of any kind, express or implied,
      including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability
      and fitness for a particular purpose or a warranty of
      non-infringement.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 label="IV">
    <title>REQUIREMENTS ON MODIFIED WORKS</title>

    <para>All modified versions of documents covered by this license, including
      translations, anthologies, compilations and partial documents, must meet
      the following requirements:</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem><para>The modified version must be labeled as
        such.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>The person making the modifications must be identified
        and the modifications dated.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>Acknowledgement of the original author and publisher if
        applicable must be retained according to normal academic citation
        practices.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>The location of the original unmodified document must be
        identified.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>The original author's (or authors') name(s) may not be
        used to assert or imply endorsement of the resulting document without
        the original author's (or authors') permission.</para></listitem>
    </orderedlist>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 label="V">
    <title>GOOD-PRACTICE RECOMMENDATIONS</title>

    <para>In addition to the requirements of this license, it is requested from
      and strongly recommended of redistributors that:</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem><para>If you are distributing Open Publication works on
        hardcopy or CD-ROM, you provide email notification to the authors of
        your intent to redistribute at least thirty days before your manuscript
        or media freeze, to give the authors time to provide updated
        documents. This notification should describe modifications, if any,
        made to the document.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>All substantive modifications (including deletions) be
        either clearly marked up in the document or else described in an
        attachment to the document.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>Finally, while it is not mandatory under this license, it
        is considered good form to offer a free copy of any hardcopy and CD-ROM
        expression of an Open Publication-licensed work to its
        author(s).</para></listitem>
    </orderedlist>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 label="VI">
    <title>LICENSE OPTIONS</title>

    <para>The author(s) and/or publisher of an Open Publication-licensed
      document may elect certain options by appending language to the reference
      to or copy of the license. These options are considered part of the
      license instance and must be included with the license (or its
      incorporation by reference) in derived works.</para>

    <para>A. To prohibit distribution of substantively modified versions
      without the explicit permission of the author(s). <quote>Substantive
      modification</quote> is defined as a change to the semantic content of
      the document, and excludes mere changes in format or typographical
      corrections.</para>

    <para>To accomplish this, add the phrase <quote>Distribution of
      substantively modified versions of this document is prohibited without
      the explicit permission of the copyright holder.</quote> to the license
      reference or copy.</para>

    <para>B. To prohibit any publication of this work or derivative works in
      whole or in part in standard (paper) book form for commercial purposes is
      prohibited unless prior permission is obtained from the copyright
      holder.</para>

    <para>To accomplish this, add the phrase <quote>Distribution of the work or
      derivative of the work in any standard (paper) book form is prohibited
      unless prior permission is obtained from the copyright holder.</quote> to
      the license reference or copy.</para>
  </sect1>
