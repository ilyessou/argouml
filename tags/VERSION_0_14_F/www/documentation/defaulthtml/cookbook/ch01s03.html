You can help, there are big tasks and small tasks waiting for you.
</p><p>
Here is a suggestion on how you could become
part of the ArgoUML Project.
This could be perceived as a ladder to climb but remember
that if so it is firstly a ladder of levels of commitment
and time spent by you.
You get no price for climbing higher, you just get more
responsibility in the project and more work.
</p><p>
	  </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Use ArgoUML.</p></li><li><p>Subscribe to the dev list.</p><p>
Monitor the discussions and as soon as you see something discussed
where you have an opinion, jump right in!
</p></li><li><p>Apply for an Observer role.</p><p>
This shows that you are commited to the project and also
allows you to enter and comment on issues etc.
</p></li><li><p>
Familiarize yourself with the project and how we work.
</p><p>
Suggestion on how to go about this:
		</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="a"><li><p>
Read through most of the User manual and install and run 
the latest version of ArgoUML.
</p></li><li><p>Subscribe to the issues list.</p><p>
You will get updates on all issues so you can monitor what
we are doing in the project.
(It could be a lot of mails.
If it turns out you don't like watching issues in this way
just unsubscibe again.)
</p></li><li><p>Subscribe to the cvs list.</p><p>
You will get updates on all changes that are done 
to code, documentation, and the web site.
(It could be a lot of mails.
If it turns out you don't like watching 
what is going on in the project in this way
just unsubscibe again.)
</p></li><li><p>
Read the process part of the Developers Cookbook at
<a href="ch12.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;12.&nbsp;Processes for the ArgoUML project">Chapter&nbsp;12, <i>Processes for the ArgoUML project</i></a>.
</p><p>
This will give you the idea of how the ArgoUML project
attempts to release with good quality and especially
how Issuezilla works.
</p></li><li><p>Get the Observer role granted.</p></li><li><p>
From this on you can report bugs yourself directly in Issuezilla.
</p><p>
You can also verify issues according to the
verification process (see <a href="ch12s05.html" title="12.5.&nbsp;How to verify an Issue that is FIXED">Section&nbsp;12.5, &#8220;How to verify an Issue that is FIXED&#8221;</a>).
</p><p>
This will help you understand the terminology used in the project
and also gives you an idea of the current quality of ArgoUML and
what needs to be done in the future.
</p><p>
This is also a very low-commitment level task that
could be completed in a couple of minutes
(depending on your choice of issue).
</p></li><li><p>Read the rest of the Developers Cookbook.</p><p>
There is a lot of stuff discussed in here that is interesting 
for your understanding of the project and the code.
</p></li><li><p>Check out the source from cvs and build.</p></li></ol></div><p>
</p></li><li><p>Familiarize yourself with the code.</p><p>
For this a good knowledge of Java is more or less a prerequisite.
</p><p>
Suggestion on how to go about this:
		</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="a"><li><p>
Take active part in the discussions on the dev-list.
</p></li><li><p>
Solve issues registered in Issuezilla.
</p></li><li><p>
Convince someone to commit your changes.
</p></li><li><p>
Repeat.
</p><p>
This can go on until you find that your main problem is the to get
someone to actually commit your changes, not because they are hard to
convince but because they don't have time to do commits to keep up with
your pace.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
</p></li><li><p>Apply for a Developer role.</p><p>
This allows you to do commits on your own and you can now increase
the pace in which you are working.
</p><p>
There are a lot of special requirements on you to get this granted.
</p><p>
Noted here for Linus to keep track on what to verify.
		</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Understanding and accepting the goals.
</p></li><li><p>
Understanding where we are in the development process.
</p></li><li><p>
Understanding the terminology used in the project.
</p></li><li><p>
Good knowledge of CVS.
</p></li><li><p>
Understanding the set of tools (ant, junit) and how to use them.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
</p></li><li><p>Focus your work in a specific area.</p><p>
Everybody has different interests and the best contribution is made
when someone is allowed to pursue his own interests.
Hopefully ArgoUML provides you with interesting challanges to
your taste.
</p></li><li><p>Accept responsibility for a specific area.</p><p>
With this you are part of the core team developing ArgoUML.
