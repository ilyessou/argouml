This contains a subset of the FOP distribution.

Also, the build directory contains a jar fop-0.20.3-custom.jar which was
compiled from the standard 0.20.3 distribution, but with jimi-1.0.jar
in the classpath.  Because of licensing issues,
jimi-1.0.jar is not included, and must be placed in the tools/lib
directory before building any documentation which uses png images,
since fop requires the jimi library to handle them.
