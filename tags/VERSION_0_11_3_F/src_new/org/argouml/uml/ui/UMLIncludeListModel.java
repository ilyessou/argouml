// 26 Mar 2002: Jeremy Bennett (mail@jeremybennett.com). Tidied up, as part of
// getting the include stuff to work. add() method tidied up to put the new
// relationship at the correct place in the list. buildPopup removed, since the
// parent implementation is fine.

// 3 Apr 2002: Jeremy Bennett (mail@jeremybennett.com). There is a bug in
// NSUML, where the "include" and "include2" associations of a use case are
// back to front, i.e "include" is used as the opposite end of "addition" to
// point to an including use case, rather than an included use case. Fixed
// within the include relationship, rather than the use case, by reversing the
// use of access functions for the "base" and "addition" associations.

// 3 May 2002: Jeremy Bennett (mail@jeremybennett.com). Extended to mark the
// project as needing saving if an include relationship is added, deleted,
// changed or moved.
