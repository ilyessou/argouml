                  a drop down menu showing the currently chosen directory and
                  alongside buttons to go up a directory, to the home directory
                  to create a new directory and to change between styles for
                  viewing directories. The main window shows the files
                  available in the chosen directory with a scroll bar to the
                  right. At the bottom we have a text box to enter the file
                  name, and below that a drop down selector of file types. To
                  the right of these last two are two buttons, Save (above) and
                  Close (below).</p></body></html>
