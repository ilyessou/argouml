              pane with two tabs labeled <tt>Perspectives</tt>
              (currently selected) and <tt>Panes</tt>. The top half
              contains a text area with a list of all the currently defined
              perspectives and to the right three buttons stacked vertically,
              labeled <tt>New</tt>, <tt>Remove</tt> and
              <tt>Duplicate</tt>. The second half contains two text
              areas. The one on the left is labeled
              <tt>Rules&nbsp;Library</tt> and contains a list of
              possible perspective rules. The one on the right is labeled
              <tt>Selected&nbsp;Rules</tt> and contains the rule list
              for the currently selected perspective (empty if no perspective
              is selected). Between these two areas are two buttons stacked
              vertically labeled <tt>&gt;&gt;</tt> and
              <tt>&lt;&lt;</tt>. At the very bottom right is a button
              labeled <tt>OK</tt>.</p></body></html>
