<LI><TT>PROJECT: font_editor</TT><BR> Add a new subclass of PropEditor
that would edit the properties of font family, size, and style (e.g.,
bold, italic). This would keep those properties together on the
property sheet and make things more compact. Also, this editor could
pop up a font selection dialog box that could have a lot of options
and allow for user-defined logical styles (e.g., "Code" is
courier-10-plain).
