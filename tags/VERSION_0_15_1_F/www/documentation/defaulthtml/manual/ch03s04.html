      case diagram 1</tt>. Select this by button&nbsp;1 click on the diagram
      name in the explorer (the upper left quadrant of the user
      screen).</p><p>New use case diagrams can be created as needed through
<tt class="literal">Create Diagram</tt> on the main menu bar or 
on the Create Diagram Toolbar. 
They are edited
      in the editing pane (the upper right quadrant of the user screen).</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e2944"></a>3.4.1.&nbsp;Actors</h3></div></div><div></div></div><a class="indexterm" name="d0e2947"></a><a class="indexterm" name="d0e2952"></a><p>To add an actor to the diagram use button&nbsp;1 click on the actor

        at the location where you wish to place it. The actor can be moved
subsequently by button&nbsp;1
motion (i.e. button&nbsp;1 down over the actor to
        select it, move to the new position and button&nbsp;1 release to drop the
        actor in place.</p><p>Multiple actors can be added in one go, by using button&nbsp;1 double
        click on the actor icon. Each subsequent button&nbsp;1 click will drop an
actor on the diagram. 
A button&nbsp;1 click on the select icon
(<span class="guiicon">

</p><p>The actors name is set in its property panel. First select the
        actor (if not already selected) on the editing pane using button&nbsp;1
        click. Then click on the <tt class="literal">Properties</tt> tab in the
        details pane. The name is entered in the name field, and will appear on

        the editing pane (or just typing on the keyboard when an actor is
        selected) will allow the name to be edited directly. This is a
        convenient way to enter a name for a new actor.</p><p>Having created the actor, you will see it appear in the explorer
        (the upper left quadrant of the user screen). This shows all the
        artifacts created within the UML design. A drop down at the top of the
        explorer controls the ordering of artifacts in the explorer.
        The most useful are the <tt class="literal">Package-centric</tt>

        relationship of the actor to the use case, although this is not usually

        itself.</p><p>Documentation for a particular artifact is recorded through the
        documentation tab in the details pane (the quadrant of the user screen
        at the bottom right).</p><p>In addition annotation may be added to diagrams using the text icon
        on the editing pane toolbar
        (<span class="guiicon"><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/icons/text.gif" align="middle"></span></span>).</p><p>The recommendation is that a use case diagram should use the
        documentation tab of actors to record information about the actor, or
        if the actor is complex to refer to a separate document that holds
        information about the actor.</p><p>The documentation tab of use cases should record the location of
        the use case specification. The information in a use case specification
        (for all but the simplest use cases) is too complex to be placed
        directly in the tab.</p><p>The project should also have a separate vision document and
        supplementary requirements specification. A text annotation on diagrams
        may be used to refer to these if the user finds this helpful.</p><div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Warning"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Warning]" src="images/warning.png"></td><th align="left">Warning</th></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top"><p>The documentation tab includes a

        annotation on diagrams (we have already mentioned the text tool). These
        are found at the right hand end of the editing pane toolbar and are
        fully documented in the reference manual (see <a href="ch09.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;9.&nbsp;The Editing Pane">Chapter&nbsp;9, <i>The Editing Pane</i></a>).</p><p>The rectangle tool can be used to draw the boundary box. Use the
button&nbsp;2 context-sensitive <tt class="literal">Ordering</tt> pop-up menu to
        place it behind everything else. However there is no way to change its
        fill color from the default white. You may therefore prefer to draw
        the boundary box as four lines. This is the method used for the
        diagrams in this chapter.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="images/note.png"></td><th align="left">Note</th></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top"><p>The editing pane in ArgoUML has a grid to which objects
