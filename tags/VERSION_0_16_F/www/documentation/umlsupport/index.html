<title>ArgoUML UML Specification Incompatibility list</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1>Known Incompatibilities</h1>
<p>Here is a list of features which are not implemented yet and can be seen as a violation of the <a href="http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?formal/00-03-01">UML specification (1.3)</a>.
<!-- Issue 403 -->
</p>
<h2>All Diagrams</h2>
<ul>
<li>Qualifiers are missing. <!-- Issue 499 -->
<li>Optional directional triangle missing on association names.
<!-- Issue 503 -->
<li>List of provided multiplicities is not complete.
<!-- Issue 1025 -->
</ul>
<h2>Class Diagram</h2>
<!-- Issue 1067 - Compliance to UML 1.3 Class Diagram Specification -->
<ul>
<li>Association classes are missing. 
<!-- Issue 393 -->
Though ArgoUML can read association classes from XMI files, 
it cannot display them correctly. 
That is due to a flaw in GEF, which needs a major rework.
<li>Parameterized classes are missing.
<li>Notes to <i>any</i> model element not implemented.
<li>Cannot add a method to an operation.
<!-- Issue 954 -->
<li>Cannot show collaborations on a class diagram.
<!-- Issue 1067 -->
</ul>
<h2>Object Diagrams</h2>
<ul>
<li>Currently not implemented, use a Deploymentdiagram.
<!-- Issue 1377 -->
<li>Attributes cannot have attribute values.
</ul>
<h2>Activity Diagrams</h2>
<ul>
<li>Swimlanes missing.
<!-- Issue 714 -->
<li>Object symbols / object flow relationships missing.
<!-- Issue 714 -->
<li>Signal receipt/sending missing.
<!-- Issue 714 -->
</ul>

<h2>Sequence Diagrams</h2>
<ul>
<li>Missing completely from ArgoUML 0.14. (They were present in 0.10.1)
</ul>

<h2>Statechart Diagrams</h2>
<ul>
<li>Regions are drawn and handled as ordinary composite states.
<!-- Issue 2433 -->
<li>There is no distinction between kinds of Actions.
<li>Distinction between kinds of Events is only partly implemented.
<!-- Issue 1622 -->
<li>A "junction" is only partially supported.
</ul>

<h1>Useful Optional Features</h1>
<h2>Class Diagram</h2>
<ul>
<li>Cannot specify <code>package</code> visibility as defined by Java.
<!-- Issue 928 -->
</ul>
