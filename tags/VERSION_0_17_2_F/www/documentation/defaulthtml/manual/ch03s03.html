          the ATM detects a fault, it may summon the engineer to fix

          associations between actors and use cases. By this we mean how many
          instances of an actor interact with how many instances of the use
          case.</p><p>By default we assume one instance of an actor interacts with one
          instance of a use case. In other cases we can label the multiplicity
          of one end of the association, either with a number to indicate how
          many instances are involved, or with a range separated by two periods
          (<tt class="literal">..</tt>). An asterisk (<tt class="literal">*</tt>) is used
          to indicate an arbitrary number.</p><p>In the ATM example, there is only one central computer, but it
          may be auditing any number of ATM uses. So we place the label

          always describe a significant chunk of system behavior, if they are
          too general they can be difficult to describe.</p><p>We could for example define the behavior of the use case
          &#8220;<span class="quote">Use ATM</span>&#8221; in terms of the behavior of three simpler
          use cases, &#8220;<span class="quote">Deposit Cash</span>&#8221;, &#8220;<span class="quote">Withdraw

          could be attached. The name and location are shown in a
          separate compartment within the use case oval. The representation
          extend relationship is the same as the include relationship, but
          with the label <span class="emphasis"><em>&laquo;extend&raquo;</em></span>. Alongside

        complexity of the use case. As a rule of thumb, most use cases take
        around 10-15 pages to specify, the bulk of which is alternate
        flows. If you are much larger than this, consider breaking the use
        case down. If you are much smaller consider whether the use case is
        addressing too small a chunk of behavior.</p><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="s3.tut.basic_flow"></a>3.3.3.1.&nbsp;Specifying the Basic Flow</h4></div></div><div></div></div><a class="indexterm" name="d0e2804"></a><a class="indexterm" name="d0e2809"></a><p>All flows in a use case specification are linear&#8212;that is
          there is no conditional branching. Any choices in flows are handled
          by specifying another alternate flow that takes over at the choice
          point. It is important to remember we are specifying behavior here,
          not programming it.</p><p>A flow is specified as a series of numbered steps. Each step
          must involve some interaction with an actor, or at least generate a
          change that is observable externally by an actor. Requirements
          capture should not be specifying hidden internal behavior of a
          system.</p><p>For example we might give the following sequence of steps for
          the basic flow of the use case "Withdraw Cash" in our ATM
          example.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Customer indicates a receipt is
            required.</p></li><li><p>Customer enters amount of cash
            required.</p></li><li><p>ATM verifies with the central computer that the
            customer can make this withdrawal.</p></li><li><p>ATM dispenses cash to the
            customer.</p></li><li><p>ATM issues receipt to customer.</p></li></ol></div><p>Remember this is a sub-use case included in the main &#8220;<span class="quote">Use

        requirements (for example about performance) may need to appear in many
        use cases and it is bad practice to replicate information. Secondly
        there are invariably some non-functional requirements that are system
