<h1> Argo Package Overview </h1>

The name of this system is "Argo", see the Argo home page for an
explanation and background on that name.  The source code is in
packages named "jargo" for Java(tm) Argo to differentiate it from the
Smalltalk version of Argo (stargo).

<h2> Domain Independent Infrastructure </h2>

<ul>
<li><B><font size=+2 color="006600">jargo.kernel</font></B>
 [ <a href="Package-jargo.kernel.html">javadocs</a> ] <br>
The abstact classes that define the key concepts of the Argo
system. This pakage (along with jargo.util and jargo.ui) make up most
of the domain-independent infrastructure that Argo provides.  Key
concepts include Design Materials, Designs, Designers, Critics,
ToDoList, ToDoItems, Criticism Control Mechanisms, Argo's Decision
Model, and a Design Goal Model.  Each of these kernel classes is
subclassed in the various domain-specific pakages as part of the
domain model.

<li><B><font size=+2 color="006600">jargo.ui</font></B>
 [ <a href="Package-jargo.ui.html">javadocs</a> ] <br>
User interface windows and widgets that are used in Argo.
Needs-More-Work: Much of this code has been or will be replaced with
code from package uci.ui.  Some other code will move into domain
specific packages (e.g., the C2 component interface browser window) or
be promoted from domain-dependent packages to here (e.g.,
jargo.softarch.SoftarchBroswer is actually pretty domain-independent).
Here to stay are windows for browsing the designers ToDoList, directly
editing the decision and goal models, and the list of loaded critics.

<li><B><font size=+2 color="006600">jargo.util</font></B>
 [ <a href="Package-jargo.util.html">javadocs</a> ] <br>
Utility classes that are used throughout Argo;s infrastructure and
domain models.  Currently there is nothing that is useful enough to go
here and so specific to Argo that it could not be placed in package
uci.util.
</ul>

<h2> Domain Models that Extend the Infrastructure </h2>
<ul>

<li><B><font size=+2 color="006600">jargo.softarch</font></B>
 [ <a href="Package-jargo.softarch.html">javadocs</a> ] <br>
This is the first domain model I ever build with Argo, and it shows
some of the marks of revision.  Includes design materials for C2 components,
C2 connectors, and about a dozen critics.  Also models what might be
considered the "OS domain" that includes operating system processes,
threads, and hosts. 

<li><B><font size=+2 color="006600">jargo.softarch.klax</font></B>
 [ <a href="Package-jargo.softarch.klax.html">javadocs</a> ] <br>
This package contains code to demonstrate the C2 software architecture
domain model and other domain models.  jargo.softarch.klax.Main is the
program that I run when giving demos. The applet
jargo.softarch.SoftarchApplet that runs on my web site also uses
jargo.softarch.klax.Main.  The classes here mainly instanciate and
configure design materials to model C2 components. These should not
have to be their own classes, but at this time (6/97) I cannot load
design material instances into my palette. This package also contains
a fre critics that are specific to the design material defined here.

<li><B><font size=+2 color="006600">jargo.process</font></B>
 [ <a href="Package-jargo.process.html">javadocs</a> ] <br>
This domain model package defines a simple process modeling domain
that is integrated with Argo's decision model.  The process domain is
loosely based on IDEF-0. This package contains a few critics to show
that Argo can have multiple domain models loaded at one time.

<li><B><font size=+2 color="006600">jargo.uml</font></B>
 [ <a href="Package-jargo.uml.html">javadocs</a> ] <br>
This is a <B>very</B> preliminary object-oriented design
domain. Calling it "UML" is more of a description of what I would like
to build with it than what is it now.  The domain consists of design
materials for classes, and one sample critic. The visualization is
somewhat noteworthy as a demostration of dynamically resizing Node
Perspectives.
