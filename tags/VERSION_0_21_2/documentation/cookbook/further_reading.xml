    <para> Cognitive Support Features for Software Development Tools </para>
    <para> The dissertation of Jason Robbins is a <emphasis>MUST
      READ</emphasis> for everyone concerned about ArgoUML. Be careful though,
      since it is based on an old version of ArgoUML, but many of the concepts remain
      intact. </para>

      <title>Abstract</title>
      <para> Software design is a cognitively challenging task. Most software
        design tools provide support for editing, viewing, storing, sharing,
        and transforming designs, but lack support for the essential and
        difficult cognitive tasks facing designers. These cognitive tasks
        include decision making, decision ordering, and task-specific design
        understanding. To date, software design tools have not included
        features that specifically address key cognitive needs of designers, in
        part, because there has been no practical method for developing and
        evaluating these features. </para>
      <para> This dissertation contributes a practical description of several
        cognitive theories relevant to software design, a method for devising
        cognitive support features based on these theories, a basket of
        cognitive support features that are demonstrated in the context of a
        usable software design tool called ArgoUML, and a reusable
        infrastructure for building similar features into other design tools.
        ArgoUML is an object-oriented design tool that includes several novel
        features that address the identified cognitive needs of software
        designers. Each feature is explained with respect to the cognitive
        theories that inspired it and the set of features is evaluated with a
        combination of heuristic and empirical techniques. </para>

      <title>Abstract</title>
      <para lang="de"> Noch vor der Erstellung eines detaillierten Entwurfs
        hilft ein Spezifikationsmodell eines komponenten-basierten Systems
        dabei, Probleme so früh im Entwicklungsprozess wie möglich zu
        entdecken. Die Sprache CCL ('Component Constraint Language') wurde bei
        CIS entwickelt und erlaubt den Entwickler 'Contextbased Constraints'
        dem Spezifikationsmodell hinzuzufügen. Dadurch entsteht ein Modell,
        das über die Beschreibung der statische Struktur des Systems
        hinausgeht. Zur Zeit existiert allerdings kein Werkzeug, dass das
        Komponentenspezifikationsmodell in den Entwicklungsprozess
        integriert. Ziel dieser Diplomarbeit war der Entwurf eines solchen
        Werkzeugs, um die Philosophie des Continuous Software Engineering
        (CSE) zu unterstützten. </para>
      <para> Before starting a detailed design, a specification model of the
        component-based system assists the software developer in early problem
        detection as soon as possible in the development process. The Component
        Constraint Language (CCL) developed at CIS enables the developer to add
        context-based constraints (CoCons) to a component specification
        model. This produces a model which goes beyond the simple description of
        the system's static structure. At this time, there is no tool to integrate
        the component specification model into the development process. The
        goal of this master's thesis was to design such a tool, thereby supporting
        the Continuous Software Engineering (CSE) philosophy. </para>
