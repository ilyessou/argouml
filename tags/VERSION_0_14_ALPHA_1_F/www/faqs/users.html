<br>
This FAQ is provided with the hopes of being helpful for users using ArgoUML for their projects.

<p>
It is a collection of tips and tricks from the ArgoUML mailing lists 
(click <a href="http://argouml.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">here</a> to see the available 
lists). It is not a complete overview but it does reflect the interests and problems that the users 
have expressed on the mailing lists.

<p>
The information is updated as the questions and answers are posted on the mailing list.
A certain version of the FAQ is only loosely connected to a specific version of ArgoUML but 
can show how a problem is solved differently in the different versions. The current "stable" version of
ArgoUML is v 0.12 and can be found <a href="http://argouml.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList">here</a>.
The current developer release is v 0.13.5 and can be found <a href="http://argouml.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=1018">here</a>.

<p>
<br>
<DT><a name="link1">What is ArgoUML?</a>
<DD>
ArgoUML is a Java based Universal Modeling Language tool. It is able to create and save most of the nine 
standard UML diagrams. More information on UML can be found <a href="http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/formal/uml.htm">here</a>.
ArgoUML also has the ability to reverse engineer compiling Java code and generate UML diagrams for it.

<p>
ArgoUML is made available under the <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/copyright/license.html">BSD</a> Open Source License.

<p>
ArgoUML is not production ready!
This means that the things you can't do will distract you, you will have problems that you won't 
have in commercial UML tools, and there is no one to blame for this. On the other hand, this also means that
you have the opportunity to fix your problems yourself.

<p>
<DT><A NAME="helpdeveloping">How can I help?</A>
<DD>
Welcome, welcome, welcome, you are most welcome!

<p>
Level 1: 
<li>Use it!</li> 
<li>Talk about it!</li>
<li>Test it!</li> 
<li>Find bugs!</li> 
<li>Report bugs!</li>

<p>
Level 2: 
<li>Help in pin-pointing and fixing bugs!</li>
<li>Dive into Issuezilla!</li>
<li>Become a developer of ArgoUML!</li>
<li>Make improvements!</li>
<li>Discuss what you want to work on on the developers mailing list.</li>

<p>
<DT><a name="manual_link">Is there a manual?</a>
<DD>Yes.
Look
<A HREF="http://argouml.tigris.org/documentation/defaulthtml/manual/">Here</A>.
<p>
<br>
<DT><a name="jws_link">What is Java Web Start (JWS)?</a>
<DD>It is a technology that allows you to start the application directly
from the web.
You don't need to bother about downloading, unpacking, installing, 
or keeping track of updates.
You just run the application.
<P>
You will need to download and install Java Web Start though
(unless you are on Mac OS 10 where it is included).
<p>
<br>
<DT><a name="source_link">Where do I get the source code for ArgoUML?</a>
<DD>You can download the source from the same server that you download the
application from.
<p>
<br>
<DT><a name="commer_link">Is there commercial support for ArgoUML?</a>
<DD>Sort of. Gentleware provides an enhanced version of ArgoUML 
called <i>Poseidon</i> that is sold with support.

<p>
See <A HREF="http://www.gentleware.com">http://www.gentleware.com</A>

<p>
<br>
<DT><a name="help_link">When I click on help I get sent to a server for example:
http://ics.uci.edu/pub/arch/uml/critics/CrMultipleAgg.html but there
isn't an ics.uci.edu server... Where can I get the help files?</a>
<DD>This was a stub for the help files that was never implemented.
<P>
In later versions of ArgoUML this "feature" is turned off.
Eventually you will be directed to the User Manual where
this information is described, but that function is not currently in
place either.

<P>
This is one of the things where we need to 
<A HREF="#helpdeveloping">do more work</A>.

<br>
<DT><H3>OS Specific</H3>
<p>
<br>
<DT><a name="osx_link">In OS X: How can I access the context sensitive menus?</a>
<DD>Press the Apple Key together with the mouse button
<p>
<br>
<DT><a name="osx_java">In OS X 10.2: How can I get ArgoUML to work?</a>
<DD>ArgoUML will not work out-of-the-box on MacOSX 10.2 for people who have the Apple Developer Tools installed, because those tools install Java 1.4.1.
<p>
There is a workaround, though: Apple leaves the 1.3.1 java engine installed, but in an obscure place. You can run ArgoUML from the Terminal window by typing
<p>
% /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.3.1/Commands/java -jar argouml.jar
<p>
<br>
<DT><a name="win_link">In Windows: How can I get ArgoUML to load when I double-click on a model file?</a>
<DD>The trick is to do things in two steps. First, open Windows Explorer and find a .zargo
file, and then right-click on it. You should get the normal Windows menu, including an Open or Open With 
option. At this point, give a description for the file like "ArgoUML Model", and tell Windows to use 
Notepad to open the file. That's not what you want to do ultimately, but it does get Windows to
accept the .zargo extension as representing a valid file type.
<p>
Now close, and then reopen Windows Explorer. If you are using a version of Windows prior to XP go to the Explorer menu and select View->Options. For XP you would use Tools->Folder Options. You should get a two (or more) tabbed dialog. Click the "File Types" dialog and
then scroll through the list for the Description you gave - in this example
"ArgoUML Model". Click to select that file type, and then click the "Edit"
button.
<p>
Now, click on the "Open" action and then the "Edit" button there. You will
then get a dialog that has a line for entering in the application action
that will have a line for using Notepad to open the file. Replace that line
with:
<p>
"C:\Program Files\Java\j2re1.4.1_01\bin\javaw.exe" -jar "c:\ArgoUML\argouml.jar" "%L"
<p>
Substitute your path to your JavaW.exe and ArgoUML.jar files if they aren't
located where specified above. Click OK, then click OK, then click OK (three buttons on
three different levels of the dialog).
<p>
You can now double-click on your model and have ArgoUML instantly loaded.

<DT><H3>Diagrams and Navigation</H3>
<p>
<br>
<DT><a name="diag_link">How do I know what diagram I'm working on?</a>
<DD>If your screen is large enough, you will see the name
of the diagram in the top right corner.
<p>
<br>
<DT><a name="actor_link">How can I sort the artifacts in the Navigation Pane, for example
sort all of my Actors?</a>
<DD>That is not currently supported.
<p>
<br>
<DT><a name="elem_link">How do I arrange my diagram elements?</a>
<DD>There are several ways to easily and elegantly move diagram elements.

<p>
Select the elements you want to move. By holding down the control key
you can select several.

<p>
Now hit your arrow keys. Your elements move a little with every key stroke.

<p>
If you also hold down the shift key, they move a bit faster.

<p>
Or click on the broom button, move your mouse to the diagram pane,
right click and hold. Now moving your mouse side ways (or up and down)
will align elements.

<p>
There also is the menu item <b>Arrange</b> where you can align, group or
nudge (move a little bit) elements.
<p>
<br>
<DT><a name="ord_link">I'm trying to change the ordering of the links in the sequence
diagram. How do I do that?</a>
<DD>That is not currently supported.
<p>
<br>
<DT><a name="state_link">How do I create a state diagram?</a>
<DD>Select a class, then you can create a state diagram.
The same applies for activity diagrams.
<p>
<br>
<DT><a name="act_link">How do I create an activity diagram?</a>
<DD>Select a use case or class, then you can create an activity
diagram. Same as for a state diagram.
<p>
<br>
<DT><a name="note_link">I see there is a note icon in the tool bar. How do I use it?</a>
<DD>Click on your target class.
Then click on the note icon.
ArgoUML will generate the link automatically.

<p>
You can also right click to add a note as well!

<p>
Be aware that your note will not appear in the source code
documentation tab but it will appear in the diagram view of the
navigation pane (the left pane tree view).
<p>
<br>
<DT><a name="easy_link">What is the easiest way to enter data into attributes and methods window for classes?</a>
<DD>Click direct class properties pane and start typing. 
<p>
<br>
<DT><a name="model_link">Where can I find some sample ArgoUML models?</a>
<DD>There are some models at:
<li><a href="http://argouml.tigris.org/models/addisonwesley/UMLDistilled.zargo">http://argouml.tigris.org/models/addisonwesley/UMLDistilled.zargo</a>
<li><a href="http://argouml.tigris.org/models/omg/uml13.zargo">http://argouml.tigris.org/models/omg/uml13.zargo</a>
<li><a href="http://argouml.tigris.org/models/omg/uml14.zargo">http://argouml.tigris.org/models/omg/uml14.zargo</a>
<li><a href="http://argouml.tigris.org/models/oreilly/nutshell4.zargo">http://argouml.tigris.org/models/oreilly/nutshell4.zargo</a>
<p>
<br>
<hr width="95%" align=center>
<br>
<DT><H3>XMI and other formats</H3>
<p>
<br>
<DT><a name="xmia_link">Does ArgoUML save .xmi files?</a>
<DD>Yes.
It saves the model information in an .xmi-file,  the diagram information in a .pgml-file and 
information about the project in a .argo file.
All of these are then zipped to a .zargo-file. 
You can easily extract the .xmi from the .zargo file using jar.
<p>
<br>
<DT><a name="xmib_link">How do I import an .xmi into ArgoUML and what formats are known to be
supported?</a>
<DD>Because of the variety of .xmi formats being generated you will
encounter problems using other .xmis generated from other
applications.
ArgoUML's native storage format is another implementation of XMI (Curt
Arnold believes that it has been hacked so it can also read the Unisys
variant).
He recommends that if you are comfortable with XSLT, you can typically
transform one variant of UML + XMI to another, plus MetaIntegrations
(<a href="http://www.metaintegration.net">http://www.metaintegrations.net</a>) makes a version of their Bridge
product available to transform between XMI flavors.
<p>
<br>
<DT><a name="rose_link">Can ArgoUML read an MDL file generated by Rational Rose?</a>
<DD>No.
MDL is a Rational Rose-specific format.
You are much better off getting Rose to export an XMI file.

<p>
Rose has an add-on that can create XMI format from an MDL file that is available <a href="http://www.rational.com/support/downloadcenter/addins/media/rose/xml_133.zip">here</a>.

<p>
You will then need a tool to convert that .XMI to a version that ArgoUML understands.
<p>
<br>
<DT><a name="addtag_link">I have a project where I need to add tags to attributes. How do I do that?</a>
<DD>Open the zargo file with any zip application and you'll find the XMI inside. If you want to convert it to XSD then go to <a href="http://xmlmodeling.com/">http://xmlmodeling.com/</a> (Dave Carlson's site) and convert the XMI there.
<p>
<br>
<DT><a name="gentle_link">I have a Gentleware project. How do I convert it to ArgoUML?</a>
<DD>If you don't have sequence diagrams in your project you can do the following to convert a Gentleware Project for use with ArgoUML:<p>
0) Make sure to backup your project first.<p>
1) Unpackage the gentleware project Project.zargo. example : (unzip Project.zargo) or (jar xvf Project.zargo)<p>
2) Then try reading and then saving the project with an appropriate UML Tool.<p>
3) Repackage the project. example (zip NewProject.zargo *.xmi *.pgml *.argo) or (jar cvf NewProject.zargo *)<p>
4) You should now be able to read the project with ArgoUML.<p>

<br>
<DT><H3>Printing and Graphics</H3>
<p>
<br>
<DT><a name="print_link">How can I print my diagrams?</a>
<DD>Select a diagram, then go to File-&#62;Export Diagrams. You can
generate gif, postscript, eps or .svg format.
<p>
<br>
<DT><a name="svg_link">What does SVG stand for?</a>
<DD>A super cool vector graphics format (like MM Flash) that is
totally open and is gaining enormous ground in the graphics
world. Find out more at the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/Overview.htm8">www.W3C.org</a>.
<p>
<br>
<DT><a name="savsvg_link">How do I save my diagram as .SVG?</a>
<DD>First: select .svg as the file type.
Second: type the name of the file as you like with the .svg tag at the end.
Example myumldiagram.svg
<p>
<br>
<DT><a name="eps_link">Can I save my diagram as EPS <B>with</B> a preview image?</a>
<DD>No.
<p>
<br>
<DT><a name="output_link">Can I output my entire project as an HTML?</a>
<DD>No.
<p>
<br>
<DT><a name="part_link">Can I control what part of a diagram that shall be saved so as to only
save a fraction?</a>
<DD>No. You will have to edit the image afterwards.
<p>
<br>
<DT><a name="xmic_link">Does ArgoUML generate an XMI document?</a>
<DD>Yes!
It is one of the files zipped into the save file (the .zargo file).
Unpack with jar.
<p>
<br>
<hr width="95%" align=center>
<br>
<DT><H3>Bugs and Other Topics</H3>
<p>
<br>
<DT><a name="bug_link">Where/how do I report bugs?</a>
<DD>Bugs are called defects.
They are stored in Issuezilla together with suggestion of new features 
and enhancements.

<P>
First see if someone else has reported the same bug by
<A HREF="http://argouml.tigris.org/issues/query.cgi">searching in Issuezilla</A>.
If so, add your additional observations as comments to that bug.

<P>
If you can't find it there 
<A HREF="http://argouml.tigris.org/issues/enter_bug.cgi?issue_type=DEFECT">report it</A>.

<p>
You need to be a registered user at Tigris and have an Observer role
in the ArgoUML project to do this. Click <a href="http://argouml.tigris.org/servlets/Join">here</a> to be taken to the Register New User page.
<p>
Note that you can also attach files to a defect report if you have a sample to show a problem, or need to do a screen capture to show something you are trying to explain.
<p>
<br>
<DT><a name="repbug_link">What information is interesting when reporting a Bug?</a>
<DD>Get a screen capture of it and a .txt copy of the stack output for analysis.

<p>
Also include what version of ArgoUML you are running and on what platform. Useful information includes:<p>
<li>Hardware - Processor and processor speed, Memory, Hard Drive space and free hard drive space<p>
<li>OS - Which OS, which version, and which patches<p>
<li>Java-version - Including whether you are running a development version or runtime version<p>
<p>
It is also helpful if you can upload the zargo project file for the project that is having problems.
<p>
<p>
<br>
<DT><a name="enhance_link">How do I suggest an enhancement?</a>
<DD>You need to be a registered user at Tigris and have an Observer role
in the ArgoUML project to do this. Click <a href="http://argouml.tigris.org/servlets/Join">here</a> to be taken to the Register New User page.
<p>
Then see if someone else has already suggested the same enhancement by
<A HREF="http://argouml.tigris.org/issues/query.cgi">searching in Issuezilla</A>.
If so, add any additional observations as comments to that enhancement.

<P>
If you can't find it there 
<A HREF="http://argouml.tigris.org/issues/enter_bug.cgi?issue_type=ENHANCEMENT">then enter it here</A>.
<p>
<br>
<DT><a name="attach_file">Something is happening when I run ArgoUML that's hard to describe. How should I send a picture or document describing it?</a>
<DD>Please DO NOT attach a file to a message that will go to one of the mailing lists. Not all of our readers and users have broadband connections, and even a 100K image can be a nightmare for folks on a slow dialup connection.
<p>
If this is actually an error or bug, you can attach your file as part of a defect report. Posting defects is described <a href="#bug_link">earlier in the FAQ</a>.
<p>
Otherwise post the file to a web site (preferably your own), and then provide the link to the mailing list.
<p>
<br>
<DT><a name="vote_link">How do I vote to indicate I think an enhancement or fix is important?</a>
<DD>To find out if you can vote on an issue and how many votes you have available, open the issue in Issuezilla that you are interested in. You will find a link Votes directly above the Additional Comments field. Beside this link you will see a number, indicating the quantity of votes you have cast for this issue, and a link to vote for the issue. Clicking on the Vote for this issue link allows you view the number of votes you have, the number of votes you've used and alter the number of votes you have applied to this issue. An email is generated notifying you of any changes that occur on issues for which you have voted. 
<p>
<br>
<DT><a name="vtcount_link">How do I see how many votes have been cast for an enhancement or fix?</a>
<DD>You can query for all issues that have at least one vote by entering "1" in the At least ____ votes field and clicking on the Submit query button. You will receive a report of all issues that have at least one vote cast for them. Using the report, you can see how many votes were cast for each issue and, by clicking on the link to the issue, you can adjust your votes as you see fit.
<p>
<br>
<DT><a name="bunch_link">I've got a bunch of people working on the same diagrams. 
How do I track who is doing what on the diagram?
How do I use ArgoUML with CVS?</a>
<DD>You can't.
ArgoUML works as if the .zargo files is a single binary file.
If several users open it at once to do work some work will be lost.
<p>
<br>
<DT><a name="sanity_link">Is there a mechanism to do a sanity check in ArgoUML and enforce that sanity check?</a> 
<DD>Yes, by paying attention to the critics. They can be found in org.argouml.lang.java.cognitive.critics for example. But Argo follows the policy that the user in the end knows more than we do. So if the user wants to generate code which doesn't compile that is currently fine with ArgoUML.
<p>
<br>
<DT><a name="empty_zargo">I saved a project from Argo, and then when I opened it later ArgoUML said it was empty. What can I do?</a> 
<DD>Often the problem is a null character or an accent. ArgoUML still doesn't deal very well with problems related to these characters. There is also some discussion of addressing this problem in a future version of ArgoUML.
<p>
<br>
<DT><a name="magic_link">Why isn't there any magic controling this FAQ where the questions and
answers are automatically generated and my problem always appear on the top
of the list?</a>
<DD>Because the developers of the ArgoUML project don't know where such
functions can be found and have not had the patience to set it up.
