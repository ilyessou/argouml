This directory and all of its subdirectories, containing the Model subsystem
implementation for the Novosoft UML library (NSUML) is OBSOLETE and no longer
used or maintained.  It has been replaced by an implementation using the
NetBeans Model Data Repository (MDR) library.

NSUML support was removed from ArgoUML during the 0.20 development cycle
in November, 2005.
