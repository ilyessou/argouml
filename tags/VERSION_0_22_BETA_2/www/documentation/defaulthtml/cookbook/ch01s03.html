      </p><p> Here is a suggestion on how you could become part of the ArgoUML Project.
      This could be perceived as a ladder to climb but remember that if so it is
      firstly a ladder of levels of commitment and time spent by you. You get no
      prize for climbing higher, you just get more responsibility in the project.
      </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Use ArgoUML.</p></li><li><p> Report found bugs. </p><p> There are bugs in ArgoUML. When you use ArgoUML you might
            encounter them where you least expect it. To help, make sure they are
            known about i.e. that there exists an issue in Issuezilla describing
            the problem. You need to be a registered user at Tigris to report bugs
            but notice that to add further comments to the issue you also need to
            have gotten a Role in the ArgoUML project. </p></li><li><p> Subscribe to the users' mailing list. </p><p> Discuss how you use ArgoUML in your project and how you promote
            ArgoUML in your organization. You can also help other users with
            their ArgoUML-related problems. </p></li><li><p>Apply for an Observer role.</p><p> This shows that you are committed to the project and also allows
            you to comment on issues. </p></li><li><p> Familiarize yourself with the project and how we work. </p><p> Suggestion on how to go about this:
            </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="a"><li><p> Read through most of the User manual and install and run
                  the latest version of ArgoUML. </p></li><li><p>Subscribe to the issues list.</p><p> You will get updates on all issues so you can monitor what
                  we are doing in the project. (It could be a lot of mails. If it
                  turns out you don't like watching issues in this way, you
                  unsubscribe!) </p></li><li><p>Subscribe to the CVS list.</p><p> You will get updates on all changes that are done to code,
                  documentation, and the web site. (It could be a lot of large
                  mails. If it turns out you don't like watching what is going on
                  in the project in this way you unsubscribe.) </p></li><li><p> Read the process part of the Developers Cookbook at <a href="ch11.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;11.&nbsp;Processes for the ArgoUML project">Chapter&nbsp;11, <i>Processes for the ArgoUML project</i></a>. </p><p> This will give you the idea of how the ArgoUML project
                  attempts to release with good quality and especially how we
                  use Issuezilla. </p></li><li><p>Get the Observer role granted.</p></li><li><p> From this on you can comment on bugs yourself directly in
                  Issuezilla. </p><p> You can also verify issues according to the verification
                  process (see <a href="ch11s05.html" title="11.5.&nbsp;How to verify an Issue that is FIXED">Section&nbsp;11.5, &#8220;How to verify an Issue that is FIXED&#8221;</a>).
                  </p><p> This will help you understand the terminology used in the
                  project and also gives you an idea of the current quality of
                  ArgoUML and what needs to be done in the future. </p><p> This is also a very low-commitment level task that could
                  be completed in a couple of minutes (depending on your choice
                  of issue). </p></li><li><p>Read the rest of the Developers Cookbook.</p><p> There is a lot of stuff discussed in here that is
                  interesting for your understanding of the project and the
                  code. </p></li><li><p>Check out the source from CVS and build.</p></li></ol></div><p> </p></li><li><p>Subscribe to the dev list.</p><p> The purpose of this is to see what the developers are discussing
            in the project. </p><p> Monitor the discussions and as soon as you see something
            discussed where you have an opinion, jump right in! </p></li><li><p>Familiarize yourself with the code.</p><p> For this a good knowledge of Java is more or less a prerequisite.
            </p><p> Suggestion on how to go about this:
            </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="a"><li><p> Take active part in the discussions on the dev-list.
                  </p></li><li><p> Solve issues registered in Issuezilla. </p></li><li><p> Convince someone to commit your changes. </p><p> Establish a relationship with one developer that has
                  volunteered to help you with the commits. That developer will
                  check that your code reaches the quality level that we strive
                  for in the project and obeys the design. </p></li><li><p> Repeat. </p><p> This can go on until the developer helping you knows that
                  you have good knowledge of the project quality and design and
                  the main problem for you two is that the sending, waiting,
                  committing, updating et.c. is extra work. </p></li></ol></div><p> </p></li><li><p>Apply for a Developer role.</p><p> This allows you to do commits on your own and you can now increase
            the pace in which you are working while also increasing your
            responsibilities in the project. </p><p> This role is granted by the Project leader after he is convinced
            that you have learned the enough about the project w.r.t.: </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p> Understanding and accepting the goals. </p></li><li><p> Understanding where we are in the development process.
                </p></li><li><p> Understanding the terminology used in the project.
                </p></li><li><p> Understanding how we use CVS in the project. </p></li><li><p> Understanding the set of tools (ant, JUnit) and how to use
                them. </p></li></ul></div></li><li><p>Focus your work in a specific area.</p><p> Everybody has different interests and the best contribution is
            made when someone is allowed to pursue his own interests. Hopefully
            ArgoUML provides you with interesting challenges to your taste.
            </p></li><li><p>Accept responsibility for a specific area.</p><p> With this you are part of the core team developing ArgoUML.
