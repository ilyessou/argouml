		<TD WIDTH="600"><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">I first learned programming back in the days of BASIC on the Apple II. When
			TurboPascal arived, it got me very excited about IDE's. I later had a chance to work with two Smalltalk environments
			and UNIX and emacs. I've always been interested in how some tools can be so much better than others. I have also
			enjoyed doing rapid prototyping and experimental programming.<BR>
<BR>
I came to Grad school with the intention of building a better software development environment with an emphasis
			on the human aspects.  What makes some languages and IDE's  more productive for people than others? I initially
			set out to build a tool that would help software designers experiment with alternative designs quickly.<BR>
<BR>
At that time, all of the names of research projects in my research group at UC Irvine were taken from Greek Mythology.
			 I borrowed a book on mythology and tried to find a tale of experimentation. The story of Jason and the Argonauts
			seemed like a good match because my name was Jason and exploration was close to experimentation as I could find.
			In that myth, &quot;Argo&quot; is the name of the ship that they sailed.<BR>
<BR>
The name &quot;Argo&quot; refers to the library of cognitive support features I implemented (e.g., design critics,
			checklists, navigational perspectives, etc.). I have also used it as the product line name for some of the applications
			of that library. The Argo/UML tool is actually the fourth in a series of tools I worked on that have cognitive
			support features provided by the Argo library.  Argo/UML is by far the largest application of the Argo library.<BR>
<BR>
I later learned more about the &quot;Argo&quot; myth and found an interesting coincidence. The ship &quot;Argo&quot;
			was made from wood cut from a magical talking tree.  The beams of wood on the ship continued to talk and warned
			the Argonauts of upcoming danger.  You could say that these were design critics!</FONT></TD>
