          the association from the use case pointing toward the actor. In
          the ATM example, the central computer is a passive actor.</p><p>This is a good example where the arrow helps, since it allows
          us to distinguish an event driven system (the ATM initiates
          interaction with the central computer) from a polling system (the
          central computer interrogates the ATM from time to time).</p><p>Where an actor may be either active or passive, depending on
          circumstances, the arrow may be omitted. In the ATM example the
          bank engineer fits into this category. Normally he is active,
          turning up on a regular cycle to service the machine. However if
          the ATM detects a fault, it may summon the engineer to fix
          it.</p><p>The use of arrows on associations is referred to as the

          instances of an actor interact with how many instances of the use
          case.</p><p>By default we assume one instance of an actor interacts with one
          instance of a use case. In other cases we can label the multiplicity
          of one end of the association, either with a number to indicate how
          many instances are involved, or with a range separated by two periods
          (<tt>..</tt>). An asterisk (<tt>*</tt>) is used
          to indicate an arbitrary number.</p><p>In the ATM example, there is only one central computer, but it
          may be auditing any number of ATM uses. So we place the label
          <tt>0..*</tt> at the use case end. There is no need for a

          describe all the behavior of the system. While use cases should
          always describe a significant chunk of system behavior, if they are
          too general they can be difficult to describe.</p><p>We could for example define the behavior of the use case
          &#8220;Use ATM&#8221; in terms of the behavior of three simpler
          use cases, &#8220;Deposit Cash&#8221;, &#8220;Withdraw
          Cash&#8221; and &#8220;Query Account&#8221;. The main use case
          could be specified by <span class="emphasis"><i>including</i></span> the behavior
          of the subsidiary use cases where needed.</p><p>Similarly the &#8220;Maintain ATM&#8221; use case could be
          defined in terms of two use cases &#8220;Maintain Equipment&#8221;
          and &#8220;Reload ATM&#8221;. In this case the two actors involved
          in the main use case are really only involved in one or other of
          the two subsidiary use cases and this can be shown on the
          diagram.</p><p>The decomposition of a use case into simpler sub-use cases is
          shown in UML by using an <span class="emphasis"><i>include relationship</i></span>,
          a dotted arrow from the main use case to the subsidiary, with the
          label <span class="emphasis"><i>&laquo;include&raquo;</i></span>.</p><div class="figure"><p><a name="fig.tut.atm_use_case_diagram_include"></a><b>Figure 3.4. Use case diagram for an ATM system showing

          behaviors in to hierarchies. However we may also want to show a use
          case that is an <span class="emphasis"><i>extension</i></span> to an existing
          use case to cater for a particular circumstance.</p><p>In the ATM example we have a use case covering routine
          maintenance of the ATM, &#8220;Maintain Equipment&#8221;. We also
          want to cover the special case of an unscheduled repair caused by
          the ATM detecting an internal fault.</p><p>This is shown in UML by the <span class="emphasis"><i>extend</i></span>
          relationship. In the main use case, we specify a name for a
          location in the description, where an extension to the behavior
          could be attached. The name and location are shown in a
          separate compartment within the use case oval. The representation
          extend relationship is the same as the include relationship, but
          with the label <span class="emphasis"><i>&laquo;extend&raquo;</i></span>. Alongside
          the extend relationship, we specify the condition under which that
          behavior will be attached.</p><p><a href="ch03s03.html#fig.tut.atm_use_case_diagram_extend" title="Figure 3.5. Use case diagram for an ATM system showing an extend&#xA;            relationship.">Figure 3.5</a> shows
          the ATM use case diagram with an extend relationship to a use case
          for unscheduled repairs. The diagram is now getting rather
          complex, and so we have split it into two, one for the maintenance
          side of things, the other for customer usage and audit.</p><p>The &#8220;Maintain Equipment&#8221; use case defines a name
          &#8220;Unsched&#8221;, at the start of its description. The
          extending use case &#8220;Unscheduled Repair&#8221; is attached
          there when the ATM detects an internal error.</p><div class="figure"><p><a name="fig.tut.atm_use_case_diagram_extend"></a><b>Figure 3.5. Use case diagram for an ATM system showing an extend

          may be a <span class="emphasis"><i>generalization</i></span> of a subsidiary use
          case (or alternatively the subsidiary is a
          <span class="emphasis"><i>specialization</i></span> of the main use case).</p><p>This is very like the extends relationship, but without the
          constraint of specific extension points at which the main use case
          may be extended, and with no condition on when the subsidiary use
          case may be used.</p><p>Generalization is shown on a use case diagram by an arrow with
          solid line and solid white head from the subsidiary to the main use
          case.</p><p>This may be useful when a subsidiary use case specializes the
          behavior of the main use case at a large number of positions and
          under a wide range of circumstances.</p><p>However the lack of any restriction makes generalization very
          hard to specify precisely. In general use an extend relationship

          the vision document, use case diagrams, use case specifications and

          is within the same business as the team who will do the development,
          this is now usually the case. The marketing department can learn use
          case based requirements capture and analysis to link to their
          customer facing activities.</p><p>However for external contract developments, customers may
          insist on a traditional &#8220;list of features&#8221; as the
          basis of the contract. Where this is the case, this section of the
          use case specification should link to the contract features that
          are covered by the use case.</p><p>This is often done through a third party tool that can link
          documents, providing automated checking of coverage, in which case
          this section is not needed, or may be generated
          automatically.</p></li></ul></div><p>The final size of the use case specification will depend on the
        complexity of the use case. As a rule of thumb, most use cases take
        around 10-15 pages to specify, the bulk of which is alternate
        flows. If you are much larger than this, consider breaking the use
        case down. If you are much smaller consider whether the use case is
        addressing too small a chunk of behavior.</p><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="s3.tut.basic_flow"></a>3.3.3.1. Specifying the Basic Flow</h4></div></div><p>All flows in a use case specification are linear&#8212;that is
          there is no conditional branching. Any choices in flows are handled
          by specifying another alternate flow that takes over at the choice
          point. It is important to remember we are specifying behavior here,
          not programming it.</p><p>A flow is specified as a series of numbered steps. Each step
          must involve some interaction with an actor, or at least generate a
          change that is observable externally by an actor. Requirements
          capture should not be specifying hidden internal behavior of a
          system.</p><p>For example we might give the following sequence of steps for
          the basic flow of the use case "Withdraw Cash" in our ATM
          example.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Customer indicates a receipt is

          reference to the basic flow. Initially we just build a list of the
          alternate flows.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="A"><li><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Customer does not require a
              receipt.</p></li><li><p>Customer's account will not support the
              withdrawal.</p></li><li><p>Communication to the central computer is
              down.</p></li><li><p>The customer cancels the
              transaction.</p></li><li><p>The customer fails to take the dispensed
              cash.</p></li></ol></div></li></ol></div><p>Subsequently we flesh out each alternate flow, by reference to
          the basic flow. For example the first alternate flow might look
          like.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="A"><li><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Customer does not require a
              receipt.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>At step 1 of the basic flow the customer
                indicates they do not want a receipt.</p></li><li><p>The basic flow proceeds from step 2 to step 4,
                and step 5 is not used.</p></li></ol></div></li></ol></div></li></ol></div><p>The convention is to number the various alternate flows as A.1,
          A.2, A.3, etc. The steps within an alternate flow are then numbered
          from this. So the steps of the first alternate flow would be A.1.1,
          A.1.2, A.1.3, etc.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e2769"></a>3.3.3.3. Iterative Development of Use Case Specifications</h4></div></div><p>Iterative development will prioritize the use cases, and the

        requirements (for example about performance) may need to appear in many
        use cases and it is bad practice to replicate information. Secondly
        there are invariably some non-functional requirements that are system
        wide and need a system wide document. Hence my preference for a single
        supplementary requirements specification.</p></td></tr></table></div><p>There should be a section for each of the main areas of
