      of designers in achieving the kind of alignment used in UML diagrams. 
      It is common for designers to roughly align objects as they are created 
      or by using simple movement commands. 
      The broom is an easy way to precisely align objects 
      that are already roughly aligned.
      Furthermore, the broom's distribution options are suited 
      to the needs of UML designers: 
      making related objects appear evenly spaced, 
      packing objects to save diagram space, 
      and spreading objects out to make room for new objects. 
      The broom also makes it easy to change 
      from horizontal to vertical alignment or 
      from left-alignment to right-alignment.
    </p><p>The T-shaped icon in ArgoUML's diagram toolbar 
      invokes the broom alignment tool. 
      
      When the mouse button&nbsp;1 is pressed while in broom-mode, 
      the designer's initial mouse movement orients the broom 
      to face in one of four directions: north, south, east, or west. 
      After that, mouse drag events cause the broom to advance 
      in the chosen direction, withdraw, or grow in a lateral direction. 
      Like a real-world push broom, the broom tool pushes diagram elements 
      that come in contact with it. 
      This has the effect of aligning objects along the face of the broom 
      and provides immediate visual feedback 
      (see the figure below). 
      Unlike a real-world broom, moving backwards 
      allows diagram elements to return to their original position. 
      Growing the broom makes it possible to align objects 
      that are not near each other. 
      When the mouse button is released, the broom disappears 
      and the moved objects are selected 
      to make it easy to manipulate them further.

      objects on the face of the broom are distributed (i.e., spaced evenly). 
      ArgoUML's broom supports three distribution modes: 
      objects can be spaced evenly across the space that they use, 
      objects can be packed together with only a small gap between them, 
      or objects can be distributed evenly over the entire length 
      of the broom's face. 
      Repeatedly pressing the space bar cycles among these three 
      distribution modes 
      and displays a brief message indicating the operation just performed:
      Space evenly, Pack tightly, Spread out and Original.
