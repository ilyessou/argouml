              <tt>Browse&nbsp;Critics&#8230;</tt>. The left half of
              the dialog is a list titled <tt>Critics</tt> with one
              row for each critic. Each row has three columns,
              <tt>X</tt>, <tt>Headline</tt> and
              <tt>Active</tt>. A scroll bar to the right of the list
              gives access to parts of the list that are not visible. The right
              half of the dialog is a series of fields under the title
              <tt>Critic Class:</tt>. First is a text box labeled
              <tt>Headline:</tt> containing the headline text of the
              critic. Below that is a drop-down labeled
              <tt>Priority</tt> containing the priority of any to-do
              items generated by this critic. Next is a text box labeled
              <tt>MoreInfo:</tt> containing the URL that contains
              more information, and to its right a button (always grayed out)
              labeled <tt>Go</tt>. Beneath this is a text area
              labeled <tt>Description</tt> containing a detailed
              explanation of what the critic means, with a scroll bar to the
              right if the text is too big to fit in the box. Below this is a
              drop-down labeled <tt>Use Clarifier</tt> with three
              options available. Beneath this are three buttons in a row
              labeled from left to right <tt>Wake</tt>,
              <tt>Configure</tt> and
              <tt>Edit&nbsp;Network</tt>. Finally at the bottom left
              is a button labeled <tt>OK</tt>.</p></body></html>
