                  subdivided into four panes. Starting at the leftmost top
                  pane, and working around the clock, you can see the
                  Navigation Pane, showing an explorer-like tree view of your
                  UML model, the Editing Pane with its tool bar, two scroll bars
                  and gray drawing area, the Details Pane with the ToDoItem tab
                  selected, and the To-do pane with a tree view of the to do
                  items, ranked into three priority levels (High, Medium and
                  Low).</p></body></html>
