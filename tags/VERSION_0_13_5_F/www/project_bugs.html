      Step by step instruction on what to do:
      <ol>
        <li>Search for the problem among the problems in 
        <a href="http://argouml.tigris.org/issues/query.cgi">the database</a>.
        <li>If found, add yourself as CC to the Issue and vote for it.
        You can then monitor its progress. You are done.
        <li>If your problem is not found or some of your peculiarities
        or details is not included in the description, go on.
        <li><a href="http://argouml.tigris.org/issues/enter_bug.cgi?issue_type=DEFECT&component=argouml">Enter a new issue</a>
        or add information to an already existing issue.
        Be sure to include 
          what version of ArgoUML you are running, 
          what version of jdk,
          all the steps that lead up to this,
          what happens, and
          what you expected to happen.
        <li>Add attachments with more information to your newly created issue
	by revisiting it and clicking Create a new attachment.
        The extra information that might be relevant for the issue 
        as attachments is
          screen shots,
          your project file,
          log files...
	If the problem is repeatable, rerun with debug logging enabled
        (<tt>java&nbsp;-Dlog4j.configuration=org/argouml/resource/full.lcf&nbsp;-jar&nbsp;argouml.jar</tt>)
        and add the log file <tt>argo_full.log</tt> from your home
        directory as attachment.

      </ol>
      You will get updates via mail when someone comments or does
      something with your issue.
      When the issue is resolved and verified, 
      close it after you have accepted the solution.
      <p>
      The life-cycle of issues and the roles of people handling them
      is described in the 
      <a href="/documentation/defaulthtml/cookbook/ch12.html">Cookbook chapter 12.</a>.

<h3>Why you should do this</h3>
By reporting bugs you are contributing to the ArgoUML project and
your help will lead to making ArgoUML a better product.
<p>
By voting you are showing your interest and help the active developers
get a good idea of what is important and what is not.
<p>
By suggesting enhancements you are contributing ideas for some
future version of ArgoUML.
<p>
If you want to contribute even more to the project
you could start with verifying issues.
No java knowledge is needed for this.
