<h1>ArgoUML Critic Browser Window</h1>

<P><IMG SRC="criticbrowser.gif"></P>

<P>ArgoUML's Critic Browser lists (at the left hand side) 
all the critics that are currently in the system and
their status. Clicking on a checkbox to the left of a critic's name will disable that critic. The rightmost column
shows the status of the critic. <br>
When a critic is selected in the table, the details of the critic are displayed
in the right-hand half of the window. Editing these attributes will change the behavior of the critic and the contents
of &quot;to do&quot; items that it produces in the future.</P>

<P>The Wake button allows you to wake up a critic that has been snoozed.</P>

<P>The Edit Network button allows you to edit the critiquing network that defines
how this critic works. This is not implemented yet.</P>
