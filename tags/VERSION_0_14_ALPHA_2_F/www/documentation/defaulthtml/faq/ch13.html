If one gets a user id with commit rights (in my case 'thn'), then a 'cvs commit' without explicitely saying for which user (I think it's the '-d' option) will look for that stored id and use this. Since 'guest' has no commit rights, this will of course fail.</p><p>Deleting the whole source tree will solve the problem, sure, but this is like we germans say: shooting blackbirds with cannons... You would need to download all sources again, and that's not necessary.</p><p>The most effective way is to change all CVS stored 'guest@cvs.tigris.org' in the source tree. Just substitute all 'guest@' by e.g. 'thn@' (be sure to use your own user id!), which can surely be done in one command on Unix systems, and the problem is solved.</p><p>I am using WinXX, so I did this by performing a recursive find in Win Explorer (searching for files containing 'guest@', marking all with ctrl+a, loading them into a multifile text editor like Textpad and do the substitution on all opened files.</p><p>And then I had the overwhelming experience of my first commit with WinCVS... :-)</p><p>Good luck, Thomas</p></div></div><div class="qandaentry"><div class="question"><p><a name="Nc7b"></a><b> </b>Can you recommend another CVS tool?

It includes a very nice CVS wizard, XML editing capabilities and...well an extremely well supported Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE).</p></div></div><div class="qandaentry"><div class="question"><p><a name="Nc82"></a><b> </b>I've got a bunch of people working on the same diagrams.
