You can use CVS to check out your own copies of project source code
files.
CVS is an open source version control for keeping track of all
modifications to project source code files. 
You can choose either a 
<A HREF="http://www.cvshome.org/downloads.html">command-line CVS client</A>
or <A HREF="http://www.cvsgui.org/download.html">WinCvs</A>
with a Windows interface.
What you can do with source files depends upon your role in this project
(<A HREF="/project/www/docs/ProjectRoles.html">Roles?</A>). 
Anyone can access the files for reading using the guest account
(with password "guest").

<h3>CVS Repository contents</h3>
ArgoUML has a few CVS directories and modules.
Their purpose is to simplify the use of cvs by allowing you to check
out only the necessary part of ArgoUML and not everything.
Below is a list of all modules and instructions on what module is
required to do what.
<P>
<UL>
<LI> <strong>argouml</strong>: everything under argouml.
<LI> <strong>argouml/src_new</strong>: contains the src
     of the <i>current</i> development
<LI> <strong>argouml/tools</strong>: contains tools that constitute
     most of the development environment for ArgoUML.
<LI> <strong>argouml/lib</strong>: contains the libs used
     by ArgoUML.
<LI> <strong>argouml/tests</strong>: contains the JUnit tests
     for everything in src_new.
<LI> <strong>argouml/modules</strong>: contains auxiliary modules.
     ArgoUML can work without them but they add extra features.
<LI> <strong>argouml/documentation</strong>: contains
     the documentation source for the manual, quick-guide and cookbook.
<LI> <strong>argouml/src</strong>: contains the 
     <i>old</i> (no longer used) sources. Currently empty.
<LI> <strong>argouml/www</strong>: contains the web site source
<LI> <strong>gef</strong>: everything under gef.
<LI> <strong>gef/src</strong>: the source of the gef library.
<LI> <strong>gef/lib</strong>: the libraries needed to build gef.
</UL>
<p>
<strong>Required for building ArgoUML:</strong>
<ul>
<li> argouml/src_new
<li> argouml/lib
<li> argouml/tools
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Required for creating documentation:</strong>
<ul>
<li> argouml/documentation
<li> argouml/lib
<li> argouml/tools
<li> argouml/www (<i>needed to install the documentation on the web site</i>)
<li> (docbook-xsl and fop must be downloaded separately).

(<A HREF="#wincvs">Skip to WinCvs checkout instructions</A>)
<P>
Before you can do a cvs checkout, you must login to that specific cvsroot.
<OL>
<LI>The command to login is:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
           <B>cvs -d :pserver:username@cvs.tigris.org:/cvs login</B><BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Login with your own password, the same as the one you use to access the site.
If you access the source in read-only mode your username is "guest" 
and your password is "guest".
<P>Then you can check out everything with:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
           <B>cvs -d :pserver:username@cvs.tigris.org:/cvs checkout argouml</B><BR><BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
When you have checked out the project, the checked out copy of remembers
the cvsroot that it belongs to so you don't need to give the 
"-d :pserver:blabla:/cvs" in subsequent cvs commands.
<P>
<LI>To check out the project source repository an individual module (if you don't need the entire repository), type:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
          <B>cvs -d :pserver:guest@cvs.tigris.org:/cvs checkout [modulename]</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
This command should result in a scrolling list of files being checked
out and a copy of them is after that stored in the local directory you
specified on your machine. Now you are ready to use your file editor
to work with individual files and make changes.
</OL>
<P>
If you wish to contribute to the project's CVS repository, you must have
"cvs-commit"-rights as a project member with the role Developer.

<h3><A NAME="wincvs">WinCvs checkout instructions</A></H3>
<P>
To use WinCvs to check out your own set of source code files, you must first set up the correct cvs root using the following steps.
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Launch WinCvs and select <B>Cvs Admin - Preferences</B>. Enter the CVSroot:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>:pserver:guest@cvs.tigris.org:/cvs</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Click OK.
<P>
<LI>If this your first cvs checkout, create a folder in Windows Explorer to hold all of your cvs project folders. Then create a subfolder for this project. (You may even want to create separate subfolders for each module if you're working in more than one.)
<P>
<LI>In WinCvs, select <B>Cvs Admin - Login</B> and enter your cvs password.
<P>
<LI>Click on the left window in the program and select a folder. Then select <B>
Cvs Admin - Checkout Module</B>. Select the project folder you created earlier.
<P>
<LI>Enter project module name and click OK. You should see a scrolling list of filenames as these are created in your folder(s).
<P>
<LI>Repeat the module creation process for each additional cvs module you wish to check out.
