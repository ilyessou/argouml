ArgoUML uses some product internally and is to some respect very 
dependant on the well functioning of these products.
This are products like GEF, NS-UML, ocl, log4j, xerces, jre, ...
</p><p>
Occasionally a bug found in ArgoUML is found to be a problem in one
of these subproducts and cannot or is extremely complicated to fix
within ArgoUML.
</p><p>
If this happens this is the way to register that Issue in Issuezilla.
</p><p>
This can be performed by any member of the project (any role).
There might be special skills involved depending on the nature of the Issue.
</p><p>
Do the following:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
During your examination of an issue you find that it is a problem
in one of the ArgoUML subproducts (GEF, NS-UML, ocl, jre, ...).
</p></li><li><p>
Write a comment in the issue stating which one of the subprojects
that is the problem (and what the problem is).
</p></li><li><p>
Post a bug in that subproducts bug reporting tool (or find the bug
already registered).
</p><p>
I am assuming that there is such a tool for all the subproducts.
If there isn't for the product in question, then explain the problem
to the responsible person for this product so that we are sure
that the problem is communicated.
</p></li><li><p>
Set the Issue in Issuezilla to RESOLVED/WONTFIX and
enter the reference from the subproducts bug reporting tool and
if possible the URL to the bug reporting tool or to the bug in question.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
The person responsible for the sourceing of the subtool in question
(Currently (December 2002) the subproduct responsible role 
is not explicitly pointed out 
but could be anyone that feels that something must be done.)
does the following for each new release of a subproduct.
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Looks at the new release of that subproduct to see
if any of the outstanding issues against that subproduct are in fact
fixed in the release.
</p></li><li><p>
If any of the issues are fixed, then he weights together
the importance of the issues fixed,
the amount of work needed to fit the new version of the subproduct
instead of the old one,
the planned releases of the subproduct with other issues promised
to be fixed,
and
the current release plan of ArgoUML.
From this he decides wether it is time to do the update of 
the subproduct within ArgoUML or to wait.
</p></li><li><p>
If he decides that it is time to update,
he adds the new version of the subproduct,
does all the needed work within ArgoUML,
tests and commits everything,
puts the issues indeed fixed in VERIFIED/WONTFIX,
and also closes the bugs registered in the subproducts bug reporting tool.
