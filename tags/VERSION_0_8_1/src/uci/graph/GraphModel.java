/** This interface provides a facade to a net-level
 *  representation. Similiar in concept to the Swing class
 *  TreeModel.<p>
 *
 * The idea is not to have a widget (like JGraph) storing all the
 * information that it should display, and the programmer having to
 * keep the widget's data in synch with the application's data.
 * Instead, the programmer defines a MModel class that gives the widget
 * access to the application data.  That way there is only one copy of
 * the data and nothing can get out of synch.  If you don't have your
 * own application data objects, there is a Default implementation of
 * the MModel that will store it for you.<p>
 *
 * Instead of asking application programmers to subclass their data
 * objects from some predefined base class (like NetNode), this
 * interface allows the use of any application object as a node, port,
 * or edge.  This makes it much easier to add a visualization to an
 * existing application.
