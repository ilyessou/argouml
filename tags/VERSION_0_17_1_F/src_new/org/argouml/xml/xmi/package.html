<p> support for loading the uml model in xmi format using nsuml.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

A file FirstProject.xmi - this is a representation of your (still empty) 
model in xmi format. If you want to know more about the Xml Metadata Interchange 
format (XMI), you can start at the following rather extensive XMI page. 
In short, XMI allows your models created with Argo/UML to be used by 
other applications. That is, only the contents 
of your model, without the graphic representation of the diagrams. 


<h2>Related Documentation </h2>
XMI is an XML based exchange format between UML tools. ArgoUML uses this as 
standard saving mechanism so that easy interchange with other tools and 
compliance with open standards are secured. XMI version 1.0 for UML 1.3 is used. 
To convert older models in XMI (Argo 0.7 used XMI 1.0 for UML1.1) to 
the latest version, Meta Integration provides a free key to their Model Bridge. 
This also permits you to convert Rational Rose models to ArgoUML! 
This currently only includes model information, 
but no graphical information (like layout of diagrams).
