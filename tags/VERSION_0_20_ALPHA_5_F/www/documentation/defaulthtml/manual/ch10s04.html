      configured for displaying in the tree by a number of
      perspectives. To this end, a drop-down at the top allows selection 
      of the explorer perspective.</p><p>Below that, there is a drop-down to select the ordering 
      of the atifacts within the hierarchy. 
      The two possibilities are "Order by Type, Name" and 
      "Order by Name". 
      The former groups all items per type, 
      and sorts them per group alphabetically on the name.
      The lattter simply sorts on name only.
    </p><p>
      The following explorer perspectives may be selected 
      in the drop-down at the top:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><tt class="literal">Package-centric</tt> (the default). The
        exploring hierarchy is organized by package hierarchy. The top level
        shows the model. Under this are all the top level packages in the model
        and all the artifacts that are directly in the namespace of the
        model.</p><p>Beneath each package are all the artifacts that sit within the
          namespace of that package, including any further sub-packages (which in
          turn have their own sub-hierarchies).
        </p></li><li><p><tt class="literal">Class-centric</tt>. (To be written)
        </p></li><li><p><tt class="literal">Diagram-centric</tt>. In this view the top
        level comprises all the diagrams in the model. Beneath each diagram is
        a flat listing of all the artifacts on the diagram. Artifacts that have
        sub-artifacts that do not appear on the diagram have their own
        hierarchy (for example attributes and operations of
        classes).</p></li><li><p><tt class="literal">Inheritance-centric</tt>. In this view the
        top level shows the model. Beneath this are all artifacts that have no
        generalization in the model. Those artifacts that have specializations
        have a sub-hierarchy showing the specializations.</p></li><li><p><tt class="literal">Class Associations</tt>. In this view the
        top level shows the model. Beneath this are all diagrams and all
        classes. All classes that have associations have a hierarchy tracking
        through the associated classes.</p></li><li><p><tt class="literal">Residence-centric</tt>. 
        In this view the model is shown at the top-level, 
        with below it only Nodes, 
        and below these only components that reside on the nodes,
        and below these components all elements that reside on the components.
      </p></li><li><p><tt class="literal">State-centric</tt>. In this view the top
        level shows all the state machines and all activity graphics associated
        with classes. 
      </p><p>Beneath each state machine is a hierarchy showing the state
        diagram and all of the states. Beneath each state is a list of the
        transitions in and out of the state.</p><p>Beneath each activity graph is a hierarchy showing the activity
        diagram and all of the action states. Beneath each action state is a
        list of the transitions in and out of the action
        state.</p></li><li><p><tt class="literal">Transitions-centric</tt>. This is very
        similar to <tt class="literal">State-centric</tt> view, but under each state
        machine is listed the diagrams and all transitions on the diagram, with
        states being shown as sub-hierarchies under their connected
        transitions.</p><p>Similarly under each activity graph is listed the diagrams and all
        transitions on the diagram, with action states being shown as
        sub-hierarchies under their connected transitions.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch10s03.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch10.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch10s05.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">10.3.&nbsp;Keyboard Behavior in the Explorer&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;10.5.&nbsp;Configuring Perspectives</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
