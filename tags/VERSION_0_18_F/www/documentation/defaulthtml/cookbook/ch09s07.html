If you are running Eclipse 3
you can find information on how to set
the development environment fitting ArgoUML.
There are several sets of instructions here depending that you can apply
separately depending on how much of the ArgoUML knowledge you would
want to include in your Eclipse.
</p><p>
If any of these instructions don't work or could be improved in some way,
please help in making them better.

This instruction is if you want to use Eclipse to download the source
and it takes you up to where you can start ArgoUML from the source.
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Set up the CVS Repository.
</p><p>
Change to the CVS Repository perspective and select 
Add CVS Repository.
Then enter the following information.
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Host:
cvs.tigris.org
</p></li><li><p>Repository path:
/cvs
</p></li><li><p>User:
<i class="replaceable"><tt>Your Tigris username.</tt></i>
</p></li><li><p>Password:
<i class="replaceable"><tt>Your Tigris password.</tt></i>
</p></li><li><p>Connection type:
pserver
(default)
</p></li><li><p>Use Default Port. (default)</p></li></ul></div></li><li><p>
Check out.
</p><p>
In the CVS Repository Exploring perspective,
unfold the newly created repository 
(called something like
:pserver:<i class="replaceable"><tt>yourname</tt></i>@cvs.tigris.org:/cvs)
and within it, HEAD.
</p><p>
Select the argouml project, right-click on it, and do Check Out As.
Check out as a project configured using the New Project Wizard.
Press the button Finish.
Select Java Project, and press Next.
Type the new project name: argouml, and press Next.
Ignore the build path settings. We will come back to them later.
Press Finish, which starts the checking out process.
You are probably directed to the Java Perspective with a question if
you want or not. At this point it doesn't matter. Just press Yes or No!
</p><p>
The download takes a while, since the download is around 60Meg.
</p><p>
Remark: 
If you are on a modem or other low bandwidth connection,
this is not recommended since you will download
all of the web site,
the source for the documentation, and
all modules,
things that you could do without unless you would want to work on them.
If you find a way to do this with less bandwidth use,
please help improving this description.
Theoretically we can come down to around 16Meg which would take around
two hours on a 56K modem.
</p></li><li><p>
Build using ant.
</p><p>
Browse to <tt class="filename">argouml/src_new/build.xml</tt>,
select the <tt class="filename">build.xml</tt>-file,
right-click on it, and do Run Ant...
This pops up the External Tools... pop up
with the Targets tab already selected.
Select compile (default target in the Targets tab),
deselect all other targets
and finally press Run.

There are some files that are built using rules in the
<tt class="filename">build.xml</tt> file.
This is the antlr files and the file containing a version.
</p></li><li><p>
Refresh the project.
</p><p>
This must be done after having built using ant to find the newly created
java files.
</p><p>
Select the top resource of the argouml project
in the Navigator (on the left),
right click and select <span><b class="command">Refresh</b></span>.
</p></li><li><p>
Set build path.
</p><p>
      In the Java perspective, select the project argouml, 
      i.e. the icon at the top of the Package Explorer.
      Then, in the menu, select Project =&gt; Properties).
    </p><p>
Enter Java Build Path
</p><p>
Under Source:
Remove everything.
Add <tt class="filename">argouml/src_new</tt>
(simply add a checkmark in front of the src_new folder icon).
Also add
<tt class="filename">argouml/tests</tt>,
<tt class="filename">argouml/modules/junit/src</tt>,
and the src directories of all other modules.
The purpose of this is to have Eclipse recompile these and
find compilation errors
as soon as your changes to any API has affected them.
Currently (July 2004) some of the modules don't compile.
</p><p>
Under Libraries:
Press the Add JARs... button and add
all files in <tt class="filename">argouml/lib</tt>.
Press the Add JARs... button and add
the file <tt class="filename">argouml/tools/ant-1.4.1/lib/xerces-1.2.3.jar</tt>.
Press the Add JARs... button and add
the file <tt class="filename">argouml/tools/junit-3.7/junit.jar</tt>.
Every time any of these jars is updated in the project you will have to 
update this in your environment by entering this dialog and
adding the new ones.
</p><p>
      Set the Default output folder to 
<tt class="filename">argouml/bin</tt>.
This will not confuse it with any of the ant-built things.
    </p><p>
Press OK.
You will be asked to accept that all resources previously built can
be removed. Press Yes.
Eclipse shall rebuild.
Verify that there are no errors, just warnings left among the problems.
If there are errors in some of the modules you will be able to 
continue your work in spite of that but it is then perhaps best to
remove those modules again from the Source list in the Java Build Path.
</p></li><li><p>
Select the class with the main method.
</p><p>
      In the Java perspective, select the project argouml, 
      i.e. the icon at the top of the Package Explorer.
      Then, in the menu, select Run =&gt; Run...). 
      This will open the dialog for creating, managing 
      and running Run Configurations.
    </p><p>
      Select Java Application on the left and press the New button. 
      Name the configuration "Run ArgoUML", 
      and press the Search... button in the Main class box.
      In the new dialog that appears (Choose Main Type), simply press OK.
    </p><p>
      This sets the Main class to: 
      <tt class="filename">org.argouml.application.Main</tt>.
    </p><p>
      Press the Run button.
      This will start ArgoUML. 
      From now on, you can start ArgoUML 
      by a single press on the Run icon in the toolbar.
    </p></li><li><p>
Verify that you can start ArgoUML from the debugger within Eclipse. 
You can do this by clicking on the Debug icon in the toolbar.

This instruction is to set up Eclipse to work according to
the ArgoUML Coding standards.
If this is not done correctly you will most likely find that you will have to
do a lot of manual edits every time Eclipse has
touched the code.
You have your tool working against you instead of for you.
On the other hand, these settings affect your Eclipse Workspace rather than
the ArgoUML project settings so if you have other projects in
the same Eclipse Workspace there might be conflicts.
For this reason, it might be a good idea to do the ArgoUML work in an
Eclipse Workspace separate from your other projects.

This instruction is to set up Eclipse to automatically find 
what, in the ArgoUML project, could be considered problems in the code.
</p><p>
You can apply these individually depending on what level of help you need
in your coding.
I (Linus Tolke) recommend that you set them all on the Warning level.
This makes them visible for you.
You can then decide to fix them or not depending on how you feel about
the code you are working with.

      Checkclipse is a plugin for Eclipse wich needs to be installed seperately.
      It enables style checking according the rules set for the ArgoUML project.
    </p><p>
      In the Java perspective, select the project argouml, 
      i.e. the icon at the top of the Package Explorer.
      Then, in the menu, select Project =&gt; Properties,

There is perhaps some fancy way of doing this but while we figure that out
this "revert to ant"-way can be used to run the tests:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
          In the menu select Window =&gt; Preferences. 
          Select Ant =&gt; Runtime at the left hand side.
          Select the tab Classpath.
          Select Ant Home Entries.
</p></li><li><p>
Press the <span><b class="command">Add Jars...</b></span> button and add
<tt class="filename">optional.jar</tt> from

</p></li><li><p>
Press OK to store the new Ant classpath entries.
</p><p>
These first items need only be done once as a set up.
</p></li><li><p>
Run ant with the 
<span><b class="command">alltests</b></span> target.
</p><p>
This is done by 
selecting in the menu: Run =&gt; External Tools =&gt; External Tools...
This will open the "Create, manage, and run configurations" dialog.
</p><p>
      Select the Ant Build at the left and press the New button.
      Rename to ArgoUML AllTests.
Then, in the Targets tab, select the <span><b class="command">alltests</b></span> target,
deselect all other targets, press the Apply button,
and finally press Run.
</p><p>
This run configuration
is remembered by Eclipse so after this the 
drop-down next to the

In the same way, you can make other run configurations 
for the other ant targets in the build.xml file.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Once you have found a failing test case and would like to investigate
that further, you can run it as a JUnit test case from within Eclipse,
making full use of the Eclipse debugger.
This is done by browsing to the test case
(in the package explorer you browse to
argouml =&gt; tests =&gt;
<i class="replaceable"><tt>whatever package</tt></i> =&gt;
<i class="replaceable"><tt>whatever class</tt></i>),
right-click on it and select Run =&gt; Debug JUnit Test.
