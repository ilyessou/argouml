This is the top level reference to the User Interface. To keep things
manageable, the description of each of the panes and the menu bar have their
own chapters.

Modifications
=============

 5 Dec 2001:  Jeremy Bennett. Broken out as a separate section from the
              original manual by Alejandro, Phillipe and Andreas.

23 Jan 2002:  Jeremy Bennett. Moved all discussion of mouse buttons in to this
              section to avoid duplication and completed the chapter.

 1 Feb 2002:  Jeremy Bennett. Realised mouse stuff largely relates to panes or
              the menu, so most broken back out again.

  <!-- The central explanation of how the mouse behaves -->

  <sect1 id="s1.ref.mouse">
    <title>General Mouse Behavior in &argouml;</title>

    <para>Mouse behaviour that is specific to the various panes of &argouml;
      (see <xref linkend="s1.ref.panes"/>) or the menu bar, is discussed in the
      chapters covering those panes and the menu bar. In this section we cover
      behaviour that is general across all of &argouml;.</para>

    <para>In a number of places in &argouml; text may be directly edited
      (for example the constraint editor&mdash;see
      <xref linkend="s2.ref.details_constraint_editor"/>). The behaviour of the
      mouse when handling text is discussed in the sections that follow.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Mouse Button Terminology</title>

      <para>&argouml; assumes a two button mouse. We will refer to the buttons
        as <quote>&button1;</quote> and <quote>&button2;</quote>. &Button1; is
        the leftmost button on a right-handed mouse, and sometimes referred to
        as the <emphasis>select</emphasis> button. &Button2; is the rightmost
        button on a right-handed mouse, and is sometimes referred to as the
        <emphasis>adjust</emphasis> button.</para>

      <para>A single depress and release of a mouse button whilst the mouse
        is still is referred to as a <emphasis>click</emphasis>. Two clicks in
        quick succession is referred to as a <emphasis>double
        click</emphasis>. Moving the mouse while holding a button down is
        referred to as <emphasis>button motion</emphasis> with the starting
        point being at <emphasis>button down</emphasis> and the end point at
        <emphasis>button up</emphasis>.</para>
    </sect2>

    <!-- Button1 click -->

    <sect2>
      <title>&Button1; Click</title>

      <para>This action is generally used to select an item for subsequent
        operations. If the item is an artifact in the navigation pane or the
        editing pane it will be highlighted.</para>

      <!-- General behaviour when editing text -->

      <sect3>
        <title>General Behaviour When Editing Text</title>

        <para>Here &button1; is used to select the point within the text at
          which operations (text entry and deletion) will take place.</para>
      </sect3>
    </sect2>

    <!-- Button1 double click -->

    <sect2>
      <title>&Button1; Double Click</title>

      <para>The behaviour of &button1; double click varies betweens panes and
        is discussed in their chapters.</para>

      <!-- General behaviour when editing text -->

      <sect3>
        <title>General Behaviour When Editing Text</title>

        <para>Here &button1; double click is used to select a complete word, or
          other syntactic unit within the text. Subsequent operations (text
          entry and deletion) will replace the selected text.</para>
      </sect3>
    </sect2>

    <!-- Button1 Motion -->

    <sect2>
      <title>&Button1; Motion</title>

      <sect3>
        <title>General Behaviour When Editing Text</title>

        <para>Here &button1; motion is used to select a range of
          text. Subsequent operations (text entry and deletion) will replace
          the selected text.</para>
      </sect3>
    </sect2>

    <!-- Shift and control keys -->

    <sect2>
      <title>Shift and Control with &Button1;</title>

      <!-- Where there is a list of things -->

      <sect3>
        <title>Within Lists</title>

        <para>This behavior applies where there is a list of things that may
          be selected. This includes various dialog boxes, and the to-do pane,
          where there is a list of to-do items to be selected.</para>

        <para>Where selections are to be made, the SHIFT key is used to with
          &button1; to <emphasis>extend</emphasis> from the original &button1;
          selection to the current position.</para>

        <para>Similarly the CONTROL key with &button1; is used to add
          individual items to the current selection. Where Ctrl-&button1; is
          used on an item already selected, that item is removed from the
          selection.</para>

        <caution><para>Users of Microsoft Windows will be familiar with the use
          SHIFT and CONTROL together to add sub-lists to an existing
          selection. &argouml; does not support this. SHIFT-CONTROL will behave
          as CONTROL.</para></caution>
      </sect3>

      <!-- General behaviour when editing text -->

      <sect3>
        <title>General Behaviour When Editing Text</title>

        <para>In a number of places in &argouml; text may be directly edited
          (for example the constraint editor&mdash;see
          <xref linkend="s2.ref.details_constraint_editor"/>). Here SHIFT
          &button1; is used to select a range of text from the previously
          selected point. Subsequent operations (text entry and deletion) will
          replace the selected text.</para>
      </sect3>
    </sect2>

    <!-- Button2 click -->

    <sect2>
      <title>&Button2; Actions</title>

      <para>&Button2; actions are all dependent on the pane or menu bar, and
        discussed in their various chapters.</para>
    </sect2>

    <!-- Button2 double click -->

    <sect2>
      <title>&Button2; Double Click</title>

      <para>&Button2; actions are all dependent on the pane or menu bar, and
        discussed in their various chapters.</para>

    <!-- Button2 Motion -->

    <sect2>
      <title>&Button2; Motion</title>

      <para>&Button2; actions are all dependent on the pane or menu bar, and
        discussed in their various chapters.</para>

  </sect1>

  <!-- General information about Panes -->

  <sect1 id="s1.ref.panes">
    <title>General Information About Panes</title>

    <para>The four sub-windows of the main &argouml; window are called
      <emphasis>panes</emphasis>. Clockwise from top left these are the
      <emphasis>navigator pane</emphasis> (see <xref
      linkend="ch.ref.navpane"/>), <emphasis>editing pane</emphasis> (see <xref
      linkend="ch.ref.editpane"/>), <emphasis>details pane</emphasis> (see
      <xref linkend="ch.ref.detpane"/>) and <emphasis>to-do pane</emphasis>
      (see <xref linkend="ch.ref.todopane"/>). At the top the editing pane is a
      <emphasis>tool bar</emphasis>.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Re-sizing Panes</title>

      <para>You can re-size panes by dragging on the divider bars between
        them. The mouse cursor changes to a vertical or horizontal bar with an
        arrow at right-angles when over the divider bars.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="s2.ref.spawn">
      <title>Looking at Different Diagrams Simultaneously</title>

      <para>&argouml; provides the ability to spawn copies of key windows. This
        is possible for the editing pane and for the tabs of the details
        pane. These can then be manipulated as separate windows and placed as
        desired on the screen.</para>

      <para>This is achieved through use of &button1; double click as described
        in sections <xref linkend="s1.ref.edit_mouse"/> and
        <xref linkend="s1.ref.details_mouse"/>.</para>

      <note><para>There is no equivalent function for the navigation or to-do
        panes.</para></note>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Reducing the Number of Panes Visible</title>

      <para>This function is not implemented directly. However you can spawn
        a pane (see <xref linkend="s2.ref.spawn"/>) and maximize this to be the
        whole window, which achieves the same thing.</para>
    </sect2>
  </sect1>

  <!-- All about the status bar -->

  <sect1 id="s1.ref.status">
    <title>The status bar</title>

    <para>The status bar is at the very bottom of the &argouml; window and is
      used to display short advisory messages. In general such messages are
      self explanatory. It is also used for debugging messages for the system
      in development&mdash;these messages can be ignored.</para>
