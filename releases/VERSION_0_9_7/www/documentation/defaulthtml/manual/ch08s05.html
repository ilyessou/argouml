        views simultaneously, with up to three panels of hierarchy. This dialog
        offers control of these panels, with an option to show or not show each
        panel, and the option of the second and third panels to be rooted at
        the selection on the previous panel, or to show the previously used
        hierarchy.</p><div class="caution" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img src="images/caution.png"></td><th>Caution</th></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top"><p>This functionality is not yet implemented in
        ArgoUML. Only the first panel is every shown, which is always rooted
        at project. All other options are grayed out and
        unavailable.</p></td></tr></table></div><p>When using the navigation pane, it is worth bearing in mind that
        this is a useful visualization of the model, it is not
        <span class="emphasis"><i>solely</i></span> for navigation and selection.  It is also
        useful for users to easily (meaning a few mouse clicks without having
        to arrange a diagram) visualize the model structured according to some
        perspective.  For example, show me the state nesting, or show me the
        class inheritance tree, or show me the package nesting, or show me the
        list of actors.</p><p>The idea with the second and third nav tree panes, is that
        sometimes it is easier to explore the tree to a certain level in one
        tree and then continue expanding in a second tree .  Since
        each tree will not be so deep, it will look more like a list.</p><p>For example, look at the way javadocs are viewed with frames: the
        packages are selected from one list, and interfaces, classes, and
        exceptions in that package are shown in a second pane.  In the case of
        javadocs, the second pane has a tree with three roots that are always
        expanded, but it is visually presented as three lists with three
        headers.</p><p>The other suggested use of a second or third nav panel is to list
        recently visited model elements.  This is simliar to the recently
        visited files listed on the <tt>File</tt> menu of most
        applications, but for model elements rather than files.</p><p>The motivtion is the fact that designers frequently
        &#8220;interrupt&#8221; themselves: they are thinking of working on
        one part of the design, and then they make a decision that needs a
        change in some other part, and then that has an implication on some
        other part, and&#8230; and&#8230; and&#8230; the designer forgets
        what it was they were originally trying to accomplish.  They need to
        &#8220;pop their mental stack&#8221; to come back to finish what the
        started.  If they fail to do that, they leave half-finished fragments
        all over the design which always seem to come out as soon as it is
        presented to someone else.</p><p>A recently visited list should be LIFO (stack) ordered, or FIFO
        (queue) ordered.  The goal would be to help designers come back to
        finish what they were doing, or simply to help them switch between two
        or three related parts of the design.  The <tt>Navigate
        Back</tt> and <tt>Navigate Forward</tt> buttons in the
        navigation pane serve the same basic purpose and use a lot less screen
        space.</p><p>ArgoUML's tear-off tabs (see <a href="ch07s04.html#s2.ref.spawn" title="7.4.2. Looking at Different Diagrams Simultaneously">Section 7.4.2</a> also
        help with alternating between views, but sometimes users dont want to
        work with some many separate windows.</p><p>This is the theory that motivates the idea of multiple nav
        panes. For more information see Jason Robbins' PhD dissertation <a href="http://argouml.tigris.org/docs/robbins_dissertation/" target="_top">
        http://argouml.tigris.org/docs/robbins_dissertation/</a>.  One
        practical usability concern is available screen space and another is
        visual complexity. For this reason the multiple panes have yet to be
        implemented in ArgoUML while more pressing issues are
        addressed.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch08s04.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch08.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch08s06.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">8.4.
