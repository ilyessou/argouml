Notes on how to install and compile the UCI Graph Editing Framework
source code version 0.6 beta 1.

This file prepared: 98/04/17.

Basic steps:

0. Make sure you have JDK 1.1.5 and Swing 1.0.1.  You can download
these from www.javasoft.com.

1. Unzip or untar the source code archive and you will have the
following directory structure:

<somepath>
        |-- uci
             |-- util
             |-- ui
             |-- graph
             |-- beans
             |   |-- editors
             |
             |-- gef
                 |-- event
                 |-- demo

Where <somepath> is the place in your directory structure where you
unpacked the files.

2. In your development environment set the CLASSPATH environment
variable so that it includes <somepath>.  Your CLASSPATH should also
include swing.jar or swingall.jar.

3. If you are using Cafe, add all the .java files to your project.

4. Compile, or run make. 

5. If you are on Solaris, run the Makefile in the uci directory with
no options. You may have to edit uci/Makefile.config to
set the proper paths for your java executables.

6. Run the main program, uci.gef.demo.BasicApplication.  Or run the
applet viewer on one of the .html files.

7. To run GEF in a browser, you still will Swing.  See the javasoft
website for instructions on how to do that.

This is just a very initial version of these instructions. If you have
trouble installing or if you are using a different development
environment, please let me know so that I can include any needed steps
in the next version of this file. EMail jrobbins@ics.uci.edu.
