This chapter contains written down ideas on what goes into what
part of the documentation. These ideas are formulated by Linus Tolke.
</p></div></div></div><p>
There are seven significantly different bits of documentation in the 
ArgoUML project.
By documentation I mean some information of the product that is 
developed alongside the product and that has a persistant value.
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p><a name="N1da6"></a>The code, variablenames, class names</p></li><li><p><a name="N1dac"></a>The javadoc</p></li><li><p><a name="N1db2"></a>The cookbook</p></li><li><p><a name="N1db8"></a>The web site in cvs</p></li><li><p><a name="N1dbe"></a>The manual and quick-guide</p></li><li><p><a name="N1dc4"></a>Help texts within the running ArgoUML</p></li><li><p><a name="N1dca"></a>The FAQ</p></li></ol></div><p>
These different bits have all different purpose and audience and 
the purpose of this chapter is to try to define that.
