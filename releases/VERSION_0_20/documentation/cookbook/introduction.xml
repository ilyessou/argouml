    <para> We, the authors, would like to take the opportunity to thank everyone
      involved in the creation of this documentation, and especially the people

    <title>About the project</title>
    <para> ArgoUML is an open source project, so it depends on people that
      volunteer to work on it. Especially in the area of development there is still
so much to do!
</para>
    <para>
This Cookbook is dedicated to everyone interested in taking
      part in the ArgoUML project as such and should help to transfer the knowledge
from the old experts to them.
Please feel free to discuss the ArgoUML project and this Cookbook on
<ulink url="mailto:dev@argouml.tigris.org">dev mailing list</ulink>!

    <title>How to contribute</title>
    <para> You can help, there are big tasks and small tasks waiting for you.
      </para>
    <para> Here is a suggestion on how you could become part of the ArgoUML Project.
      This could be perceived as a ladder to climb but remember that if so it is
      firstly a ladder of levels of commitment and time spent by you. You get no
      prize for climbing higher, you just get more responsibility in the project.
      <orderedlist numeration="arabic">

        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para> Report found bugs. </para>
          <para> There are bugs in ArgoUML. When you use ArgoUML you might
            encounter them where you least expect it. To help, make sure they are
            known about i.e. that there exists an issue in Issuezilla describing
            the problem. You need to be a registered user at Tigris to report bugs
            but notice that to add further comments to the issue you also need to
            have gotten a Role in the ArgoUML project. </para>

                <para> You will get updates on all issues so you can monitor what
                  we are doing in the project. (It could be a lot of mails. If it
                  turns out you don't like watching issues in this way, you

                  documentation, and the web site. (It could be a lot of large
                  mails. If it turns out you don't like watching what is going on
                  in the project in this way you unsubscribe.) </para>

                <para> This will give you the idea of how the ArgoUML project
                  attempts to release with good quality and especially how we
                  use Issuezilla. </para>

              <listitem>
                <para> From this on you can comment on bugs yourself directly in
                  Issuezilla. </para>
                <para> You can also verify issues according to the verification
                  process (see <xref linkend="verify_resolved_fixed"/>).
                  </para>
                <para> This will help you understand the terminology used in the
                  project and also gives you an idea of the current quality of
                  ArgoUML and what needs to be done in the future. </para>
                <para> This is also a very low-commitment level task that could
                  be completed in a couple of minutes (depending on your choice
                  of issue). </para>
