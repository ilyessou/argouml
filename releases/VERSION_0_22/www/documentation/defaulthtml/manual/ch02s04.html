        make ArgoUML different: i) it makes use of ideas from cognitive 
        psychology, ii) it is based on open standards; iii) it is 100% 
        pure Java; and iv) it is an open source project.</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e747"></a>2.4.1.&nbsp;Cognitive Psychology</h3></div></div></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e750"></a>2.4.1.1.&nbsp;Theory</h4></div></div></div><p>ArgoUML is particularly inspired by three theories 
            within cognitive psychology: i) reflection-in-action, ii) 
            opportunistic design iii) and comprehension and problem 
            solving.</p><div class="sect4" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="d0e755"></a>2.4.1.1.1.&nbsp;Reflection-in-Action</h5></div></div></div><p>This theory observes that designers of complex 
              systems do not conceive a design fully-formed. Instead, 
              they must construct a partial design, evaluate, reflect 
              on, and revise it, until they are ready to extend it 
              further.</p><p>As developers work hands-on with the design, their 
              mental model of the problem situation improves, hence 
              improving their design.</p></div><div class="sect4" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="d0e762"></a>2.4.1.1.2.&nbsp;Opportunistic Design</h5></div></div></div><p>A theory within cognitive psychology suggesting 
              that although designers plan and describe their work in 
              an ordered, hierarchical fashion, in reality, they choose 
              successive tasks based on the criteria of cognitive 
              cost.</p><p>Simply stated, designers do not follow even their 
              own plans in order, but choose steps that are mentally 
              least expensive among alternatives.</p></div><div class="sect4" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="d0e769"></a>2.4.1.1.3.&nbsp;Comprehension and Problem Solving</h5></div></div></div><p>A design visualization theory within cognitive 
              psychology. The theory notes that designers must bridge a 
              gap between their mental model of the problem or 
              situation and the formal model of a solution or 
              system.</p><p>This theory suggests that programmers will benefit 
              from:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Multiple representations such as program 
                  syntactic decomposition, state transitions, control 
                  flow, and data flow. These allow the programmer to 
                  better identify elements and relationships in the 
                  problem and solution and thus more readily create a 
                  mapping between their situation models and working 
                  system models.</p></li><li><p>Familiar aspects of a situation model, which 
                  improve designers' abilities to formulate 
                  solutions.</p></li></ol></div></div></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e783"></a>2.4.1.2.&nbsp;Practical Application in ArgoUML</h4></div></div></div><p>The implementation of these theories within ArgoUML 
            is through a number of techniques.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>The design of a user interface which allows the 
                user to view the design from a number of different 
                perspectives, and allows the user to achieve goals 
                through a number of alternative routes.</p></li><li><p>The the use of processes running in parallel with 
                the design tool, evaluating the current design against 
                models of how &#8220;<span class="quote">best practice</span>&#8221; design might 
                work. These processes are known as <span class="emphasis"><em>design 
                critics</em></span>.</p></li><li><p>The use of <span class="emphasis"><em>to-do lists</em></span> to 
                convey suggestions from the design critics to the user, 
                as well as allowing the user to record areas for future 
                action.</p></li><li><p>The use of checklists, to guide the user through 
                a complex process.</p></li></ol></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e810"></a>2.4.2.&nbsp;Open Standards</h3></div></div></div><p>UML is itself an open standard. ArgoUML throughout has 
          tried to use open standards for all its interfaces.</p><p>The key advantage of open standards is that it permits 
          easy inter-working between applications, and the ability to 
          move from one application to another as necessary.</p><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e817"></a>2.4.2.1.&nbsp;XML Metadata Interchange (XMI)</h4></div></div></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>XML Metadata Interchange (XMI)</em></span> 
            is the standard for saving the meta-data that make up a 
            particular UML model. In principle this will allow you to 
            take the model you have created in ArgoUML and import it 
            into another tool.</p><p>This clearly has advantages in allowing UML to meet 
            its goal of being a standard for communication between 
            designers.</p><p>The reality is not quite this good. Prior to UML 2.0
            the XMI file includes no information about the graphical 
            representation of the models, so diagram layout is lost. 
            ArgoUML gets round this by saving graphical information 
            separately with the model (see <a href="ch02s05.html#s3.tut.loadsave" title="2.5.3.1.&nbsp;Loading and Saving">Section&nbsp;2.5.3.1, &#8220;Loading and Saving&#8221;</a>
            ).</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e830"></a>2.4.2.2.&nbsp;Graphics Formats - SVG, PNG, JPEG</h4></div></div></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)</em></span> 
            is a recent standard proposed to the W3C Standardization 
            body (<a href="http://www.w3c.org" target="_top">www.w3c.org</a>) 
            by Adobe (
            <a href="http://www.adobe.com" target="_top">www.adobe.com</a>). 
            As yet it is not widely adopted, but is likely to become 
            the standard for graphical data that is based on vectors 
            (i.e. lines) rather than bitmaps.</p><p>For now ArgoUML saves diagrams using an earlier 
            proposed standard, <span class="emphasis"><em>Portable Graphics Markup 
            Language (PGML)</em></span>. However it has the option to 
            export graphical data as SVG for those who can make use of 
            it.</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e848"></a>2.4.2.3.&nbsp;Object Constraint Language (OCL)</h4></div></div></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Object Constraint Language (OCL)</em></span> 
            is the UML standard for expressing constraints within 
            diagrams that express the dynamic behavior of a 
            design.</p><p>At present OCL is quite new and not widely available. 
            ArgoUML is one of the few CASE tools to provide 
            comprehensive support.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e857"></a>2.4.3.&nbsp;100% Pure Java</h3></div></div></div><p>Java was conceived as an interpreted language. It 
          doesn't have a compiler to produce code for any 
          particular target machine. It compiles code for its own 
          target, the <span class="emphasis"><em>Java Virtual Machine 
          (JVM)</em></span>.</p><p>Writing an interpreter for a JVM is much easier than 
          writing a compiler, and such machines are now incorporated 
          into almost every Web Browser. As a result most machines can 
          run Java, with no further work.</p><p>(In case you wonder why all languages aren't like 
          this, it is because interpreted languages tend to be slower 
          than compiled languages. However with the high performance of 
          modern PCs, the trade-off for portability is worthwhile for 
          many applications. Furthermore modern multi-level caches can 
          mean that interpreted languages, which produce denser code, 
          may actually not be that much slower anyway.)</p><p>By choosing to write ArgoUML in pure Java, it is 
          immediately made available to the maximum number of users 
          with the minimum amount of effort.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e871"></a>2.4.4.&nbsp;Open Source</h3></div></div></div><p>ArgoUML is an <span class="emphasis"><em>open source</em></span> project. 
          That means anyone can have a free copy of the source code, 
          change it, use it for new purposes and so on. The only 
          (major) obligation is that you pass your code on in the same 
          way to others. The precise nature of what you can and 
          can't do varies from project to project, but the 
          principle is the same.</p><p>The advantage is that a small project like ArgoUML 
          suddenly is open to a lot of additional help from those who 
          can chip in their ideas for how the program might be 
          improved. At any one time their may be 10, 15, 20 or more 
          people making significant contributions to ArgoUML. To do 
          that commercially would cost $1m+ per year.</p><p>Its not just a spirit of pure altruism. Contributing is 
          a way of learning &#8220;<span class="quote">hands-on</span>&#8221; about leading edge 
          software. Its a way of getting a lot of visibility (over 
          100,000 people had downloaded ArgoUML by the spring of 2001). 
          That's a lot of good experience on a resum&eacute; and a lot of 
          potential employers seeing you!</p><p>And its great for the ego!</p><p>Open Source doesn't preclude making money.
