This version of MDRAnt was created by deleting all the createFoo() methods
(eg createReadXMI) from org.netbeans.mdrant.MdrTask so that Ant 1.7 
can't find them and call them in preference to the addReadXMI style of
methods.

This version will work with both Ant 1.6.5 (and probably earlier) as well
as Ant 1.7.
