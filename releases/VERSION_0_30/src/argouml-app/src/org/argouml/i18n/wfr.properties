wfr.UML142.ActionState.3-head = Transitions originating \
    from an action state have no trigger event.
wfr.UML142.ActionState.3-desc = Well-Formedness Rule 3 \
    for an ActionState.\n\
    As soon as the incoming \
    transition of an ActionState is triggered, its entry action starts \
    executing. Once the entry action has finished executing, the \
    action is considered complete. When the action is complete, \
    then the outgoing transition is enabled. \n\n\
    Hence the outgoing transition shall not have a trigger event.\n\n\
    To address this, remove the trigger event.


wfr.UML142.Actor.1a-head = Actors can only have \
    Associations that are binary.
wfr.UML142.Actor.1a-desc = Well-Formedness Rule 1a for an Actor.\n\
    Actors can only have associations that are binary.\n\n\
    To address this, remove association ends from the association.
wfr.UML142.Actor.1b-head = Actors can only have \
    Associations to UseCases, Subsystems, and Classes.
wfr.UML142.Actor.1b-desc = Well-Formedness Rule 1b for an Actor.\n\
    Actors can only have \
    Associations to UseCases, Subsystems, and Classes.
wfr.UML142.Actor.2-head = Actors cannot contain any Classifiers.  
wfr.UML142.Actor.2-desc = Well-Formedness Rule 2 for an Actor.\n\
    Actors cannot contain any Classifiers.  


wfr.UML142.AssociationClass.1-head = The names of the \
    AssociationEnds and the StructuralFeatures do not overlap.
wfr.UML142.AssociationClass.1-desc = Well-Formedness Rule 1 \
    for an AssociationClass.\n\
    The names of the AssociationEnds and the StructuralFeatures \
    do not overlap.
wfr.UML142.AssociationClass.2-head =  An AssociationClass \
    cannot be defined between itself and something else.
wfr.UML142.AssociationClass.2-desc =  Well-Formedness Rule 2 \
    for an AssociationClass.\n\
    An AssociationClass cannot be defined between itself \
    and something else.


wfr.UML142.Classifier.5-head = The name of an opposite \
    AssociationEnd may not be the same as the name of an Attribute \
    or a ModelElement contained in the Classifier.
wfr.UML142.Classifier.5-desc = Well-Formedness Rule 5 \
    for a Classifier.\n\
    The name of an opposite AssociationEnd may not be the same \
    as the name of an Attribute or a ModelElement contained in the Classifier.


wfr.UML142.DataType.1-head = A DataType can only contain \
    Operations, which all must be queries.
wfr.UML142.DataType.1-desc = Well-Formedness Rule 1 \
    for a DataType.\n\
    A DataType can only contain Operations, which all must be queries.


wfr.UML142.GeneralizableElement.1-head =  A root cannot have any \
    Generalizations.
wfr.UML142.GeneralizableElement.1-desc = Well-Formedness Rule 1 \
    for a GeneralizableElement.\n\
    A root cannot have any Generalizations.
wfr.UML142.GeneralizableElement.4-head = The parent must be \
    included in the Namespace of the GeneralizableElement.
wfr.UML142.GeneralizableElement.4-desc = Well-Formedness Rule 4 \
    for a GeneralizableElement.\n\
    The parent must be included in the Namespace of the \
    GeneralizableElement.


wfr.UML142.Namespace.2-head = All Associations must have \
    a unique combination of name and associated Classifiers in \
    the Namespace.
wfr.UML142.Namespace.2-desc = Well-Formedness Rule 2 for a \
    Namespace.\n\
    All Associations must have a unique combination of name and \
    associated Classifiers in the Namespace.


wfr.UML142.UseCase.1-head = UseCases can only have \
    binary Associations.
wfr.UML142.UseCase.1-desc = Well-Formedness Rule 1 for a UseCase.\n\
    UseCases can only have \
    binary Associations.
wfr.UML142.UseCase.2-head = UseCases cannot have \
    Associations to UseCases specifying the same entity.
wfr.UML142.UseCase.2-desc = Well-Formedness Rule 2 for a UseCase.\n\
    UseCases cannot have \
    Associations to UseCases specifying the same entity.  
wfr.UML142.UseCase.3-head = A UseCase cannot contain \
    any Classifiers. 
wfr.UML142.UseCase.3-desc = Well-Formedness Rule 3 for a UseCase.\n\
    A UseCase cannot contain any Classifiers. 
wfr.UML142.UseCase.4-head = The names of the \
    ExtensionPoints must be unique within the UseCase. 
wfr.UML142.UseCase.4-desc = Well-Formedness Rule 4 for a UseCase.\n\
    The names of the ExtensionPoints must be unique within the UseCase.
