/**
 * A Critic can be disabled for a certain amount of time by giving it
 * the snooze command.  Whereas most ControlMech's activate or deactivate
 * Critic's based on evidence of the Designer's state of mind, this
 * command allows the Designer to disable Critic's without stating any
 * reason.  However, after a period of time, the critic may become
 * active again.  We think this will often be convienent because
 * Designer's have a lot of tacit knowledge about their own state of
 * mind that is not worth making explicit.
