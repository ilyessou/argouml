    <title>Organization of ArgoUML documentation</title>
    <section>
    <title>Overview</title>
    <para>
There are seven significantly different bits of documentation in the
ArgoUML project.
By documentation I mean some information of the product that is
developed alongside the product and that has a persistent value.

<!-- An overview of how the manual should be written -->
<section>
  <title>User Manual Plans</title>
  <!-- Target audiences -->

  <para>
The User Manual is a very separate part of the ArgoUML project.
It is independent of the rest of the project w.r.t. updates,
deliveries, ambition and plans.
The development of the User Manual is more or less a project of its own.
Since autumn 2003 we also have an appointed sub project leader for this.
This Responsibility is called Editor for the User Manual and Quick Guide
and is held by Michiel van der Wulp.
</para>
  <para>
This section describes the ambition and plans for the User Manual.
</para>

  <section>
    <title>Target Audiences for the User Manual</title>

    <para>Target audiences are the following:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>Experienced users of UML in &ooad; (perhaps with other
        tools) who wish to transfer to &argouml;.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>Designers who know &ooad;, and wish to adopt a UML
        based process.</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>In the longer term it would be desirable to also target the
      following.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>Those who are learning design and wish to start with a
        UML based &ooad; process.</para></listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>
People interested in modularized code design with a GUI.
</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </section>

  <!-- Goals -->

  <section>
    <title>Goals for the User Manual</title>

    <para>The goals are (in priority order):</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
A tutorial style explanation of &argouml;
        in the context of an &ooad; process.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para><emphasis>Descriptive</emphasis> reference material on
        all components of ArgoUML</para></listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>
Keep boundaries clearly defined, to avoid 
duplication with the Cookbook, FAQ, Quick Guide, on-line help etc. 
</para>
      </listitem>

    </orderedlist>

    <para>
I (probably Jeremy Bennet in 2002?) think the existing User Manual 
is a good start particularly towards
      the second of these goals.</para>

    <!-- Non-Goals -->

    <section>
      <title>What the User Manual is not (currently)</title>

      <para>To keep the effort feasible the user manual should avoid the
        following (at least initially).</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>Providing a quick overview&mdash;the Quick Guide
         already does this.</para></listitem>

        <listitem><para>Listing all the errors and what they mean. The help
          system does this&mdash;one day the manual will link to
          that.</para></listitem> 

        <listitem><para>Explaining the internal workings of ArgoUML. The
          cookbook, combined with Jason Robbins dissertation is already a good
          start for this.</para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </section>      
  </section>

  <!-- Structure -->

  <section>
    <title>Suggested Manual Structure</title>

    <para>
Here are my (Jeremy Bennet, 2002?) thoughts.
I think the user manual is really a set of two
      books, the tutorial manual (corresponding to Part I of the
      current manual), and the reference manual (Part II of the current
      manual)</para>

    <para>
I (Jeremy Bennet, 2002?) suggest that the tutorial book be based
around an &ooad; process
      (any preferences), and that each UML concept is introduced with each step
      of the process, followed by an explanation of how to do it under
      &argouml;. A <emphasis>simple</emphasis>case study will be needed
throughout.

    <title>Actions, Priorities and Questions</title>

    <para>
This section has two serious problems.
Firstly, I (Linus Tolke, 2004) think Jeremy Bennet wrote this and then 
started and has completed a lot of the items so they could be checked off.
Secondly, keeping this list in a docbook document is not a good idea.
It is better to make issues in Issuezilla of it that can be 
individually closed.
I (Linus Tolke 2004) will make issues of the things 
I think are left to be done and remove this section
(unless someone beats me to it).
</para>

    <section>
      <title>Actions and priorities</title>

      <para>Here's my first call for what needs to be done in priority
        order. From the comments made over the last few days I think the first
        5 items won't take very long, meaning effort can concentrate on the
        main stuff.</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem><para>Get buy-in for the approach. (Completed)</para></listitem>

        <listitem><para>Agree document structure (broadly). (Completed)</para></listitem>

              and artifacts (assume the reader knows UML already, and allows a
