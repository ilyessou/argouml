  <para>
    Purpose - To handle generating and editing 
    in different languages 
    of a textual representation 
    which represents 
    one or more UML modelelements.
    Such a notation element gets e.g. attached to 
    a diagram figure 
    or an explorer entry. 
  </para>
  
  <para>
    The notation subsystem is located in
    <classname>org.argouml.notation</classname>.
  </para>

  <para>
    The interface NotationProvider4 is at the center of the subsystem. 
    There is an object implementing the NotationProvider4 interface 
    per string (i.e. textual model representation) 
    that is shown on the diagram: 
    e.g. TransitionNotation, StateBodyNotation, ModelElementNameNotation. 
    A state will show the latter 2.
  </para>
  <para>
    This notation object would keep track of 
    which UML objects it represents, 
    generate and parse and provide a help text.
  </para>

  <para>
    This notation object should listen to model changes, 
    instead of the Fig. 
    Putting the latter task into this Notation class 
    (instead of the Fig) 
    has the advantage that 
    the knowledge to which uml objects to listen 
    is centralised where it is needed, 
    and not any more in the Fig.
  </para>

  <para>
    These Notation objects are abstract, 
    since they are specialised in classes that implement them 
    for a certain language, i.e. one per language. 
    So, we will have: TransitionNotationUML, TransitionNotationJava, ... etc. 
  </para>

  <para>
    The NotationProviderFactory2 is a singleton, 
    since it is the accesspoint for all Figs to access 
    the textual representation of modelobjects, 
    and since plugin modules can add extra languages.
