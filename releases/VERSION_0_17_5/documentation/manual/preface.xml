  <title>Preface</title>

  <para>Software design is a cognitively challenging task. Designers must
    manually enter designs, but the primary difficulty is decision-making
    rather than data-entry. If designers improved their decision-making
    capabilities, it would result in better designs.</para>

  <para>Current CASE tools provide automation and graphical user interfaces
    that reduce the manual work of entering a design and transforming a design
    into code. They aid designers in decision-making mainly by providing
    visualization of design diagrams and simple syntactic checks. Also many
    CASE tools provide substantial benefits in the area of version control and
    concurrent design mechanisms. One area of design support that has been not
    been well supported is analysis of design decisions.</para>

  <para>Current CASE tools are usable in that they provide a GUI that allows
    designers to access all the features provided by the tool. And they support
    the design process in that they allow the designer to enter diagrams in the
    style of popular design methodologies. But they typically do not provide
    process support to guide the designer through the design task. Instead,
    designers typically start with a blank page and must remember to cover
    every aspect of the design.</para>

  <para>&argouml; is a domain-oriented design environment that provides
    cognitive support of object-oriented design. &argouml; provides some of the
    same automation features of a commercial CASE tool, but it focuses on
    features that support the cognitive needs of designers. These cognitive
    needs are described by three cognitive theories:
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem><para>reflection-in-action;</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>opportunistic design; and</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>comprehension and problem solving.</para></listitem>
    </orderedlist>
  </para>

  <para>&argouml; is based directly on the UML 1.3 specification. In fact, a
    large part of &argouml; was generated automatically from the UML
    specification. &argouml; is (to the best of our knowledge) the only tool
    that implements the UML meta-model exactly as specified. In contrast,
    current commercial tools use basically the same internal representation of
    the design that they used in previous versions.</para>

  <para>Furthermore, it is our goal to provide comprehensive support for OCL
    (the Object Constraint Language) and XMI (the XML Model Interchange
    format), which many other tools do not support.</para>

  <para>&argouml; was originally developed by a small group of people as a
    research project.  &argouml; has many features that make it special, but it
    does not implement all the features that commercial CASE tools
    provide.</para>

    types of the

This manual is the cumulative work of several people and has been
evolving over several years.
<!--
 TODO: Eventually move this to a "historic view of this manual"
       in one of the appendices (D or E)?
 -->
Connected to the release 0.10 of &argouml;, Jeremy Bennett, 
wrote a lot of the new material that was added to 
the earlier versions
by Alejandro Ramirez, Philippe Vanpeperstraete and Andreas Rueckert.
He also added things from some of the other documents namely
the developers cookbook by Markus Klink and Linus Tolke,
the Quick Guide by Kunle Odutola, and
the FAQ by Dennis Daniels.
Connected to the release 0.14 changes were made by Linus Tolke, 
and by Michiel van der Wulp.
These changes were mostly to adopt the manual to the new functions
and appearance of &argouml; version 0.14, and introduction of the index.
The users and developers that have contributed by providing valuable input, 
such as review comments or observations while reading and using this manual
are too many to name.
</para>

  <para>&argouml; is available for free and can be used in commercial
    settings. For terms of use, see the license agreement presented when you
    download &argouml;.  We are providing the source code for &argouml; for you
    to review, customize to your needs, and improve.  Over time, we hope that
    &argouml; will evolve into a powerful and useful tool for everyone to
    use.</para>

  <para>This User Manual is aimed at the working designer, who wishes to make
    use of &argouml;. The manual is presently written assuming familiarity with
    UML, but eventually it will support those new to UML.</para>

  <para>
The manual is written in DocBook/XML and available as both HTML and PDF. 
<!-- However due to the limitations of the tools currently
available to produce PDF, this version has some layout anomalies.-->
