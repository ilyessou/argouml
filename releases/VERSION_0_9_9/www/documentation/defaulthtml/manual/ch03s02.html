The Requirements Capture Process</h2></div></div><p>We start with a top level view of the problem we are solving and the
      key areas of functionality that we must address in any
      solution. This is our <span class="emphasis"><i>vision document</i></span>, and should
      be just a few pages long.</p><p>For example the top level view of an automated teller machine (ATM)
      might be that it should support the following.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Cash deposit, cash withdrawal and account inquiries by
        customers.</p></li><li><p>Maintenance of the equipment by the bank's engineers, and
        unloading of deposits and loading of cash by the local bank
        branch.</p></li><li><p>Audit trail for all activities sent to the bank's central
        computer.</p></li></ol></div><p>From this top level view we can extract the principle activities of
      the system, and the external agents (people, equipment) that are involved
      in those activities. These activities are known as <span class="emphasis"><i>use
      cases</i></span> and the external agents are known as
      <span class="emphasis"><i>actors</i></span>.</p><p>Actors may be people or machines. From a practical standpoint it is
      worth knowing the stakeholder behind any machine, since only they will be
      able to engage with the requirements capture process.</p><p>Use cases should be significant activities for the system. For
      example customer use of the ATM machine is a use case. Entering a PIN
      number is not.</p><p>There is a gray area between these two extremes. As we shall see it
      is often useful to break very large use cases into smaller sub-use
      cases. For example we may have sub-use cases covering cash deposit, cash
      withdrawal and account inquiry.</p><p>There is no hard and fast rule. Some architects will prefer a small
      number of relatively large use cases, others will prefer a larger number
      of smaller use cases. A useful rule of thumb is that any practical
      project ought to require no more than about 30 use cases (if it needs
      more, it should be broken into separate projects).</p><p>We then show the relationship between use cases and actors on one or
      more use case diagrams. For a large project more than one diagram will be
      needed. Usually groups of related use cases are shown on one
      diagram.</p><p>We must then give a more detailed specification of each use
      case. This covers its normal behavior, alternative behaviors and any pre-
      and post-conditions. This is captured in a document variously known as a
      <span class="emphasis"><i>use case specification</i></span> or <span class="emphasis"><i>use case
      scenario</i></span>.</p><p>Finally, since use cases are functional in nature, we need a document
      to capture the non-functional requirements (capacity, performance,
      environmental needs etc). These requirements are captured in a document
      known as a <span class="emphasis"><i>supplementary requirements
      specification</i></span>.</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e2261"></a>3.2.1. Process Steps</h3></div></div><p>The steps in the requirements capture process can be summarized as
        follows.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Capture an overall view of the problem, and the desired
          characteristics of its solution in the <span class="emphasis"><i>vision
          document</i></span>.</p></li><li><p>Identify the <span class="emphasis"><i>use case</i></span> and
          <span class="emphasis"><i>actors</i></span> from the vision document and show their
          relationships on one or more <span class="emphasis"><i>use case
          diagrams</i></span>.</p></li><li><p>Give detailed <span class="emphasis"><i>use case
          specifications</i></span> for each use case, covering normal and
          alternate behavior, pre- and post-conditions.</p></li><li><p>Capture all non-functional requirements in a
          <span class="emphasis"><i>supplementary requirements
          specification</i></span>.</p></li></ol></div><p>In any iterative development process, there will be an exercise of
        prioritization, and early iterations will focus on capturing the key
        behavior of the most important use cases.</p><p>Most modern requirements capture processes agree that it is
        essential that the authoritative representative of the customer is
        fully involved throughout the process.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch03.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch03.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch03s03.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter 3.
