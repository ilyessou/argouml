It is able to create and save most of the nine UML diagrams without problem. It has the ability to reverse engineer compiling java .class code and generate UML diagrams. Output features are available but the save component of Argo has known problems.</p><p>But that's not to say that it is also one of the most powerful UML tool under BSD Open Source License. It's also one of the better supported OS projects! </p><p>Argo UML is in full sail! That is to say Argo has not locked up on me once!</p><p>The waters are choppy in places (nasty currents in the Save waters), unpredictable winds (Will it open old documents? Will I be able to reuse the software maps I've already created?</p><p>The navigation charts are set with DocBook XML. I'm using xmledit from xmlmind.com for this document. Together we'll get Argo from the development port to the production port!</p><p>Understandably when you get into a boat you plan on going somewhere. But don't plan on a cross Atlantic trip with Argo, it's more appropriate for a lake cruise in calm weather.</p><p>Argo is NOT production ready! Meaning you will get distracted by the things you can't do and you'll feel like your drowning sometimes if you've used commercial UML tools. But, hey, Argo started as an academic project, not a commercial project. And, it's free, the potential is there, that's clear, because you are here...</p><p>All open source projects are as useful and helpful as the users and developers identify and implement use cases, code, correct misunderstandings, identify bugs, and help with the documentation!</p><p>We need your help and here's how.</p><p>Use it!</p><p>We've made it easy to get and to use! Use the Java Web Start (JWS)Version ! This will give you the latest "stable" build. </p><p>Technically, the latest version of Argo can Reverse Engineer compiling Java code...which means we will soon have all of the classes of Argo in UML form! That'll help everyone to better understand and advance the code and, most importantly...usability!</p><p>We'll help you along the way too! Please specify your Argo version and your OS when making your requests for help.</p><p>Try to get into the habit of modeling your questions using UML! It'll help you learn the 'ins and outs' of UML and it'll give the developers and the users a better idea of how to use Argo, what does and does not work AND for budding developers a chance to model real code!</p><p>If you're comfortable coding, jump into the developer's galley and build Argo from the inside out with the CVS. The CVS has functionality's that have not been deemed ready for JWS release yet. Give it a try! You'll find some tips on using the CVS in this user document.</p><p>Want more?</p><p>Reverse engineer the use case and activity diagrams of the usage of Argo. Do this using Argo!</p><p>Then, model the Use cases you would like to see implemented in Argo! Model the activities, the classes, the states, the activities. Then re-engineer Argo itself and see how your model of a UML tool compares to Argo!</p><p>We're sure that at no matter your UML skills working through the reverse engineering process will be satisfying.</p><p>At this point you will have mastered the very sophisticated mapping of programming and problem solving. And you will have learned a number of highly valued skills in program analysis, business case analysis, and communication analysis. In fact you will have learned how to communicate some of the most sophisticated ideas in a way that anyone with a little training can understand.</p><p>Save your diagrams as .zArgo! And mail them to the user group as attachments! This will help all of us by building a library of UML diagrams for reference and for development purposes!</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table summary="Navigation footer" width="100%"><tr><td align="left" width="40%"><a href="ch01s02.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td align="center" width="20%"><a href="index.html">Home</a></td><td align="right" width="40%">&nbsp;<a href="ch03.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td align="left" width="40%">1.2.
