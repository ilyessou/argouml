// 31 Jan 2002: Jeremy Bennett (mail@jeremybennett.com). Extended to recognise

//  4 Feb 2002: Jeremy Bennett (mail@jeremybennett.com). Code factored by use

// 15 Feb 2002: Jeremy Bennett (mail@jeremybennett.com). Code factoring

/**
 * <p>A critic to detect whether a class violates the conditions required for
 * using a Singleton Stereotype.</p>
 *
 * <p>This stereotype is used to indicate a class which only ever has a single
 * instance. The critic will trigger whenever a class has stereotype
 * &laquo;Singleton&raquo; (or &laquo;singleton&raquo;), but does not meet the
 * requirements of a Singleton class. These are:</p>
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>An static variable to hold the sole instance of the class;</li>
 *
 *   <li>only private constructors to create the sole instance; and</li>
 *
 *   <li>At least one constructor to override the default constructor.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>The original version would always trigger for any class with stereotype
 * &laquo;Singleton&raquo;. This version includes an implementation for the
 * three tests above!</p>
 *
 * <p>Internally we use some of the static utility methods of the {@link
 * org.argouml.cognitive.critics.CriticUtils CriticUtils} class.</p>
 *
 * @see <a href="http://argouml.tigris.org/documentation/snapshots/manual/argouml.html/#s2.ref.critics_singleton_violated">ArgoUML User Manual: Singleton Violated</a>
