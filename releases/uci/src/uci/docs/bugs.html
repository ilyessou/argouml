<H1>Bugs in GEF v05</H1>

This file prepared on 5/30/97.

<p>Each bug is named with a unique string (e.g.,
"save_memory_hog"). For some bugs there are comments in the code that
indicate where the bug is manifested. Also there are references in the
feature list to these bugs. You can follow the references by using a
multi-file search command (e.g., grep) or you can use tags if you use
emacs. A tag file with entries for bugs and features can (soon) be
downloaded from the GEF web site.

<p>When sending a new bug report please check the GEF home page for
specific instructions and existing bugs that describe your problem.

<H2>Bugs observed on all platforms:</H2>

<UL>
<LI> <A NAME="shift_click">
<TT>BUG:shift_click </TT><br>
Shift-click when selecting does not always do the right thing.  It
should deselect an item that is already selected, but it does
not. Shift-drag seems to work.

<LI><A NAME="rectilinear_arc_constraints">
<TT>BUG:rectilinear_arc_constraints </TT><br>
ArcPerspective does not draw properly. It looks pretty bad and
sometimes the lines make a "T" intersection when it should make a
right anngle turn. I know that there are missing cases to the logic
that decides how to draw the arc. This really needs to be totally
redone.

<LI><A NAME="focus_for_redraw">
<TT>BUG:focus_for_redraw </TT><br>
Undersome browsers the applet frames will not be redrawn until you
move your mouse into the frame.

<LI><A NAME="save_memory_hog">
<TT> BUG:save_memory_hog </TT><br>
Saving large documents with connected nodes requires setting the
amount of stack space used by the Java VM. Use "java -ss1m" to set the
stack size to 1 Mb, by default the stack size is something like 4
Kb. Unfortuanely, you cannot set the stack size in the appletviewer or
most browsers.

<LI><A NAME="saved_file_versioning">
<TT>BUG:saved_file_versioning </TT><br>
Since there is no versioning support in Sun's ObjectSerialization
library, if you change your class definitions there is no easy way to
load files saved with the old class definitions.

<LI> <A NAME="arc_translate">
<TT>BUG:arc_translate </TT><br>
ArcPerzRectilinear should move when both their end points move at
the same time. To see what I mean: place two nodes, connect the nodes,
select all objects, move the nodes all around. You will see that some
points on the arc stay put.

<LI><A NAME="rectilinear_arc_points">
<TT>BUG:rectilinear_arc_points </TT><br>
ArcPerzRectilinear inserts too many points when it does it's
initial routing. There is no command to redo the routing. And
FigPoly's even/odd convention for rectilinear polylines is not
followed properly, so it is possible to get diaganol lines if you drag
some handles around. Also, self-arcs (arcs that go from a port on a
node to another port on the same node), are not routed properly.

<LI><A NAME="save_under_jdk1">
<TT>BUG:save_under_jdk1_0_2 </TT><br>
I updated my version of Sun's ObjectSerialization libary, and much
to my dispare I found that saving and loading no longer work under
jdk1.0.2. The problem is that classes such as java.util.Hashtable must
implement java.io.Serializable, but they do not in jdk1.0.2. So there
is really nothing I can do, other than stop using Hashtables and
Vectors. Instead I just use jdk1.1.1 for building applications.
(Applets cannot currently load or save anyway, but adding the ability
to use a URL would be a good project).

<LI><A NAME="switch_tabs_without_apply">
<TT>BUG:switch_tabs_without_apply </TT><br>
When auto-apply is off, users can loose changes if the switch tabs
before pressing the "Apply" button.
</UL>

<H2>Bugs observed on Sun's Appletviewer under solaris:</H2>
<UL>
<LI> <A NAME="sun_choice_not_shown">
<TT>BUG:sun_choice_not_shown </TT><br>
Some Choice components are not drawn, but you can still click on
them and use them.

<LI> <A NAME="sun_no_key_focus">
<TT>BUG:sun_no_key_focus </TT><br>
In InBrowserApplet.html the drawing area is in the same frame as the
palette. Keystrokes are intercepted by AWT so you cannot type keyboard
commands for GEF and you cannot type text into a FigText.

<H2>Bugs observed under Win95:</H2>
<UL>
<LI><A NAME="win_no_button_background">
<TT>BUG:win_no_button_background  </TT><br>
Button colors cannot be changed to highlight which command is "stuck"
when you set the "sticky" check box.

<LI> <A NAME="win_list_double_click">
<TT> BUG:win_list_double_click </TT><br>
List items send their action event on mouse-down when the user double
clicks.  It should be on mouse-up. The effect is that you can spawn a
new editor from the Execute Action window and the first events it will
recieve will be mouse drag, without ever seeing a mouse down event.
That can cause unexpected behavior.

<LI> <A NAME="win_color_picker_buried">
<TT> BUG:win_color_picker_buried </TT><br>
The ColorPickerGrid window should come to the front of all windows
when you click on a PropEditorColor. Under jdk1.1.1 on windows the
call to toFront() has no effect.

<LI><A NAME="win_prop_sheet_grabs_focus">
<TT> BUG:win_prop_sheet_grabs_focus </TT><br>
The TabPropFrame property sheet sometimes jumps in front of other
windows when it is not desired. This also sets the keyboard focus to
the property sheet window, so you can no longer tab through
DiagramElements unless you click on the editor window to assign
keyboard focus back there.
