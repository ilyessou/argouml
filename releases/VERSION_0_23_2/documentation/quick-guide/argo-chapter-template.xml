	This is a documentation template for a chapter in the ArgoUML manual.
	It was designed by Kunle Odutola for use in the ArgoUML ducumentation
  	effort. Please use the template as the basis for writing additional 
	chapters for the manual. 
	All the words written in UPPERCASE are placeholders and should be replaced.
	Please not that _id_ must be unique wihin the entire ArgoUML DocBook manual 
	document so, you are encouraged to prefix all subsequent _id_ with the
	chapter id thus:
		If CHAPTER-ID is "installation", you may then have "installation-windows",
		"installation-system" etc...

	Please remember that this is only a template and you are free to deviate
	from it where there is a benefit to doing so. In this event please post 
	your ideas to the ArgoUML mailing list and I may update this template with 
	your idea.
	
	Please help to keep the ArgoUML manual logical and readable. And don't forget 
	to remove these comments from the final documentation!  ;-)
