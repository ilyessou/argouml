The directory argouml/tools/dummy provides the same functionality
as is intended by CVSROOT/Emptydir.

The use of CVSROOT/Emptydir can be found at
http://www.cvshome.org/docs/manual/cvs_2.html#SEC19
in the description of 'Repository'.

Helm on Tigris does not allow the use of CVSROOT/Emptydir in this way
unless the user has update access to CVSROOT.  This provides a workaround.

This approach was borrowed with thanks from the fine group
at www.netbeans.org.
