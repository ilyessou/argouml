     *   that an association role is more tightly constrained than its
     *   parent.</p>
     *
     * <p>Then loop through the ends, building a list of end names that we
     *   have seen, and looking to see if the current end is already in that
     *   list. We ignore any ends that are unnamed, or have the empty string
     *   as name.</p>
     *
     * <p>Whilst this is an O(n^2) algorithm, most associations have only two
     *   ends, so this is unlikely to cause difficulty.</p>
