/**
 * An instances of this class is supposed to be attached to an instance
 * of another class to uniquely identify it. It is intended that such
 * a tagging should be persistent over saving and loading, if applicable.<p>
 *
 * The class also harbors the
 * {@link #getIDOfObject getIDOfObject(Object, boolean)} which provides
 * a way to get the ItemUID of any object with a method
 * <code>ItemUID getItemUID()</code>
 * and creating new ItemUIDs for any object with a method
 * <code>setItemUID(ItemUID)</code>
 * using reflection in java.<p>
 *
 * A class intended to be tagged must at least provide a
 * <code>ItemUID getItemUID()</code>
 * method. It may also provide a
 * <code>void setItemUID(ItemUID id)</code>
 * such that getItemUID() will return id if a call returns successfully,
 * and which is stored persistently should the tagged object be stored.
 * This allows this class to automatically tag an object when necessary,
 * but it is allowed to tag classes by other means and only provide the
 * getItemUID() call.<p>
 *
 * A critical requirement for this class is that the cognitive component
 * is supposed to work with general objects. This class is a wrapper around
 * places where the component needs persistent identities of objects, since
 * I have said that some features cannot be implemented without that, such as
 * ResolvedCritic, and so far noone has shown me wrong (though I wouldn't
 * mind). It is for this reason that some perhaps ugly looking exceptions in
 * this code must be considered perfectly normal conditions. Failure of some
 * object to work with tagging must be handled by the cognitive component
 * programmer and it is (see eg ResolvedCritic).<p>
 *
 * A possible future change would be to allow tag handlers to be registered
 * with this class to handle other preexisting tagging mechanisms, which
 * could be used to remove the dependancy to the model component here, which
 * I find a bit unaesthetic. So far, not enough to write it (though it is not
 * much work).
